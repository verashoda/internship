[4:24:07] <chris9ttv> basic squat technique is to squat down like you are gonna shit in the woods.. too far forward and you shit on yourself and too far back and you will fall in shit

[4:42:29] <sv_tetsuo88> You should get you a simple $500 limit credit card, and use it for gas and little things. Immediately pay it down and never pay the monthly minimal. A lot of people don’t know this, but minimal payments on credit cards actually hurt your credit.
[4:42:34] <Evan420> @m0E_tv Sicne I have no credit, is getting a secured credit card a good idea and just use it for gas and food? And pay the minimum

[4:46:56] <K4M1LMONSTER> Yo
[4:47:02] <sv_tetsuo88> @drjabree Sure! Simply put, you should get a credit building credit card! Depending on how much you make, you should get a $500 credit limit with the best APR you can. When you use that card you want to use it for gas, little purchases that you can immediately back down. So if you spend $45 on your credit card for gas, you just want to put that money right back. NEVER get in a habit of using your credit card to pay other billls. This is one of the fastest ways to build credit
