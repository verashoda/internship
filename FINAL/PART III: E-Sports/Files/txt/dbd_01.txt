[0:15:57] <davidvonkurt> !doctor build
[0:15:58] <Nightbot> The Doctor can induce survivors into madness actively with his shocks or passively with his terror radius. Madness makes survivors scream and can apply various debuffs. He has an average movement speed (115%) and terror radius (32m). Although his chasing potential is limited, his ability to deny stealth at critical times can come in very handy.
[0:16:00] <venuszg> @Otzdarva ARE YOU LISTENING TO A PLASTIC LOVE REMIX
[0:16:01] <vinceblake_> @kasperowicz_ about 4.5 million bp
[0:16:07] <ArtoTime45> !nightmare
[0:16:07] <Nightbot> The Nightmare can teleport to unfinished generators to exert pressure across the map. His other abilities depend on his add-ons, and can be either fake illusory pallets or dream snares that slow down survivors on contact. To mitigate these powers, survivors must avoid falling asleep by not getting hit or waking up by failing skill checks, finding awake survivors or interacting with a certain map prop. He has an average movement speed (115%) and an alternating terror radius/song lullaby (32m).
[0:16:07] <masemagohma> can I see the trapper skin otz daddy

[0:22:22] <Vickotine> @Otzdarva the disadvantage of this skin is, that it's so sexy that when survivors look behind, it's not to dead hard but to stare at you

[0:22:24] <thegreatpaskenti> I've only been playing survivor, I've really wanted to play killer but it's a little intimidating

[0:50:02] <GoffderDamerone> Hey everyone otzHi
[0:50:06] <EmperorBarst> @Otzdarva what she should have done is leave the locker when you picked the other survivor up
[0:50:15] <MilkyWatto> getting every perk but monitor in the bloodweb for Micheal
[0:50:21] <ruben2kills> never played this game but it looks like a ton of fun

[1:03:45] <Lock8221> @jeanilixg I actually do play on console. I played before the optimization patch and it was horrible playing as killer. It's a lot better now though
[1:03:47] <rancor_too_op> -1
[1:03:48] <Human_Kirby> I am still not sure why NoED gives you a speed boost
[1:04:01] <kaquka> kaquCozy
[1:04:02] <renegadecop50> adrenaline and NOED are counterbalanced to each other
[1:04:04] <ThePsychoSpiderTTV> NOED = SabaPing
[1:04:06] <rancor_too_op> It gives you speed so theres something to tier
[1:04:12] <jeanilixg> @Lock8221 wait, there was an optimization patch?
[1:04:13] <skillzskillzdollabillz> why didnt you equip wake up otz youd open the exit gates faster :^)

[1:32:00] <Nightbot> The Hag places down traps and can teleport to them when they are triggered by survivors. She has a reduced movement speed (110%) and a smaller terror radius (24m). If she manages to to set up a good perimeter, the Hag is terrifying and will make quick work of careless survivors.

[1:36:47] <thespacer64> @davidnwky LMAO
[1:36:50] <annigator_> !plague
[1:36:51] <Nightbot> The Plague releases a vomit that infects survivors and objects. This infection spreads on touch and will eventually injure survivors. She has an average movement speed (115%) and terror radius (32m). Her vomit can also become damaging on contact, but only if survivors drink from fountains to heal the disease.

[1:41:18] <numbscar> clown*
[1:41:21] <hellosarahx0> Dead by daylight is like a box of chocolates when it comes to survivors you never know what you’re gonna get, sometimes a sweet “gg” other times very salty messages that make you cringe lol
[1:41:26] <rebelrob73> @Otzdarva tips for adept david?
[1:41:30] <OmgImBlurry> do adept challenges right after rank reset
[1:41:33] <saltybriar> How is blood warden on clown?
[1:41:38] <MateiGamingRo> !spirit
[1:41:38] <Nightbot> The Spirit phases into an alternate dimension, where she can't see or be seen by survivors, only to quickly reappear at a new spot. When not phasing, she has a reduced movement speed (110%) and a small terror radius (24m). Her ability to mind-game survivors in almost any situation makes her one of the strongest Killers in the game.
[1:41:41] <EnderQuantum> only thing you can do is doing the achievement on rank reset
[1:41:41] <blazzzze_> doctors own perks don't work well on him
[1:41:41] <BoldlyBadly> As a survivor main, I love when Clown and Huntress run exhaustion addons Kappa
[1:41:42] <genashi> @lichy_popo If you're having fun you're playing DBD wrong.

[1:42:26] <lichy_popo> @genashi I'd have fun if I wasn't horrible but at least by being miserable i play correctly
[1:42:26] <Dark_Reef> @missmeong I'm okay, just tired a little, thanks for asking otzLove And how are you? elaH
[1:42:30] <DuncaPunca> tips for adept david: no killer cannot handle the might of no mither, win purely out of sheer dominance
[1:42:33] <jeanilixg> @Otzdarva is there a difference between twitch prime and a normal subscription?
[1:42:34] <MateiGamingRo> !wraith
[1:42:34] <Nightbot> The Wraith uses his bell to turn almost invisible and move faster while he masks his presence. When not cloaked, he has an average terror radius (32m) and movement speed (115%). His efficiency at finding survivors and catching them off-guard is his main strength, but he has no other tools to assist him in a chase.

[1:43:25] <firedustpt> clown is boring
[1:43:25] <BoogieMan976> @jeanilixg Prime will not automatically renew like a normal subscription but that's the only difference
[1:43:26] <Kitsuneternal> Otz, it seems like make your choice is a favorite peek of yours recently
[1:43:26] <Otzdarva> !goodbuild
[1:43:27] <Nightbot> Looking for a good build for a specific Killer? This video has them all covered: https://youtu.be/vFF0iMH9oTU
[1:43:27] <Yoshi_in_Green> Was so happy to catch a strem from the beginning but now I can barely keep my eyes open feels bad man
[1:43:27] <Flowingrage> !clown
[1:43:28] <Nightbot> The Clown throws bottles to create gas clouds that slow down any survivors in them. He has an average movement speed (115%) and terror radius (32m). Although he can stop survivors from looping, he still needs to put in the work to make that count.
[1:43:29] <tedy257> hello

[1:43:30] <hadezord7> @Otzdarva Could you go check something I sent you on your twitch DM's if it's not too much to ask?
[1:43:31] <znxeverything> What are your thoughts on Detective Tapp and his perks @Otzdarva ?
[1:43:32] <Yoshi_in_Green> have a good night everyone
[1:43:33] <sugawolf85> Do you like the Pig? @Otzdarva
[1:43:35] <r_r_8_8_> Watched today's video, seems like Whispers is a must for basically everyone.
[1:43:37] <MateiGamingRo> can you play with survivors? say my name
[1:43:37] <Dark_Reef> @Lachsabbath Hey otzHi PepePls
[1:43:38] <Toa_Ignika> b-but @Otzdarva what about the new skin showcase ? otzGasp
[1:43:40] <LucyferJr> @tedy257 tomatoKiss
[1:43:42] <captaincarrot__> otz you really love this game huh, good to see you having a ton of fun as always
[1:43:42] <lichy_popo> REMEMBER: DON'T HAVE FUN
[1:43:46] <Surrevalla> clown bill cosby skill when?
[1:43:49] <lichy_popo> OR U DO GAME RONG
[1:43:53] <TrueWm> wait, what is having fun?
[1:43:54] <tedy257> how are you
[1:44:02] <Nightowl579> OTZ WHAT IS THIS TITLE HHAHHAHAA
[1:44:03] <OOM2000> Is the underwater Trapper skin available now?
[1:44:11] <kiito_g> pig is your waifu
[1:44:12] <OOM2000> Wait
[1:44:14] <OOM2000> IS IT OUT?
[1:44:17] <the_outsider_x> !clown
[1:44:17] <bentpigeon> Hey @Otzdarva Hey chat otzHi
[1:44:17] <Nightbot> The Clown throws bottles to create gas clouds that slow down any survivors in them. He has an average movement speed (115%) and terror radius (32m). Although he can stop survivors from looping, he still needs to put in the work to make that count.
[1:44:20] <bruceofwar> @Otzdarva do you ever spice things up somehow playing dbd? laeThonk
[1:44:21] <claracake9> @OOM2000 Yeah!
[1:44:24] <jeanilixg> @Otzdarva I find it funny how sometimes I can play with lvl 1 killers and get an easy 4K and other times with my lvl 50 Doctor I can't get a sinlge kill
[1:44:25] <OOM2000> NO
[1:44:26] <firedustpt> can they release chuggy already
[1:44:27] <LucyferJr> @bentpigeon tomatoKiss
[1:44:30] <OOM2000> NO MY WALLET
[1:44:31] <nachote27> !wraith
[1:44:32] <Nightbot> The Wraith uses his bell to turn almost invisible and move faster while he masks his presence. When not cloaked, he has an average terror radius (32m) and movement speed (115%). His efficiency at finding survivors and catching them off-guard is his main strength, but he has no other tools to assist him in a chase.
[1:44:35] <firedustpt> I need chuggy in this game
[1:44:37] <OOM2000> YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME
[1:44:41] <bruceofwar> laeWut
[1:44:42] <R3troHelix> @Otzdarva if you could delete a killer perk and a survivor perk from the game, what would it be ?
[1:44:43] <blazzzze_> itsesp1Lul
[1:44:44] <EveningJazz> THICC CLOWM
[1:44:45] <bentpigeon> @LucyferJr otzLove
[1:44:46] <jeanilixg> @BoogieMan976 oh ok
[1:44:46] <mike1yroshevsky> !doctir
[1:44:48] <rickyturtlez> How can clown keep up with that belly
[1:44:49] <Dark_Reef> Hey @bentpigeon otzHi Nice to see ya PepePls
[1:44:50] <sickcrom_> I just found a popsicle in the freezer PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[1:44:52] <znxeverything> !pig
[1:44:53] <Nightbot> The Pig can attach a device on survivors that can potentially kill them if it's not removed. She has an average movement speed (115%) and terror radius (32m), but she can crouch to mask her presence and perform a dash attack out of it. While her traps can slow down the game a bit, she must still get the work done herself.
[1:44:53] <shadezzzz> I'm worried that I'm going to have to grind a lot to get perks and addons even if I only want to play one killer.
[1:44:53] <mike1yroshevsky> @doctor
[1:44:54] <CannonFighter29> i like how the clowns map is on an asylum
[1:44:55] <Ev3ntic> @bentpigeon otzHi
[1:44:56] <OOM2000> Do you know how much I've saverificed?
[1:44:57] <carmine9000yeet> lol
[1:44:58] <lichy_popo> STOP HER! SHE'S HAVING FUN!!
[1:45:05] <DuncaPunca> you have exhaustion otz!
[1:45:08] <bentpigeon> @Dark_Reef hey again! otzLove
[1:45:09] <captaincarrot__> the angle on that bottle throw is so funky
[1:45:14] <firedustpt> PLS I NEED CHUCKY
[1:45:14] <bentpigeon> @Ev3ntic otzLove
[1:45:17] <nachote27> !shape
[1:45:17] <Nightbot> The Shape stares at survivors to build up his power. He starts out slow and stealthy and later moves on to gain an average speed (115%) and a reduced terror radius (16m). When fully powered, he can one-shot survivors temporarily.
[1:45:19] <firedustpt> I NEED CHUCKY IN THIS GAME
[1:45:20] <Dark_Reef> @bentpigeon elaH
[1:45:25] <PeterOhneT> you put on exhaustion addons no dead hards!!!
[1:45:27] <memerativo> Pog aim
[1:45:29] <Ev3ntic> @bentpigeon how are youu? otzLove
[1:45:30] <claracake9> Clown's Throw arc is Sooooooooo weird
[1:45:32] <cadaza_> you have exhaustion addon dont you? no DH for them
[1:45:41] <Lightpino> How does clown even lean forward to pick up people NotLikeThis
[1:45:43] <TearyMov> !clown
[1:45:43] <Nightbot> The Clown throws bottles to create gas clouds that slow down any survivors in them. He has an average movement speed (115%) and terror radius (32m). Although he can stop survivors from looping, he still needs to put in the work to make that count.
[1:45:44] <mike1yroshevsky> !doctor
[1:45:44] <Nightbot> The Doctor can induce survivors into madness actively with his shocks or passively with his terror radius. Madness makes survivors scream and can apply various debuffs. He has an average movement speed (115%) and terror radius (32m). Although his chasing potential is limited, his ability to deny stealth at critical times can come in very handy.
[1:45:58] <the_outsider_x> be careful with maurice
[1:45:59] <SA_Vengarr> Do you explain why you like Brutal Strength in that video, Otz? Everyone usually calls it trash
[1:46:03] <bentpigeon> @Ev3ntic my back hurts but I went and saw some geckos today so I'm v happy about that
[1:46:05] <Gearguts> Why not do corrupt intervention on clown?
[1:46:09] <EmperorBarst> LULW
[1:46:11] <EmperorBarst> that play
[1:46:25] <Ev3ntic> @bentpigeon ooh! sounds nice, hope your back feels better soon! otzLove
[1:46:27] <mike1yroshevsky> @huntress
[1:46:35] <firedustpt> !clown
[1:46:35] <Nightbot> The Clown throws bottles to create gas clouds that slow down any survivors in them. He has an average movement speed (115%) and terror radius (32m). Although he can stop survivors from looping, he still needs to put in the work to make that count.
[1:46:40] <YesIAnchor> I see the time with techy has payed off
[1:46:49] <SA_Vengarr> 20% faster pallet smashing just doesn't seem that useful, especially since you don't normally kick gens often
[1:46:51] <MacCaran> that horse WutFace
[1:46:55] <mike1yroshevsky> !trapper
[1:46:55] <Nightbot> The Trapper can place down bear traps to catch and immobilize survivors. He has an average terror radius (32m) and movement speed (115%). He can cripple survivors without even chasing them, but this requires very careful and time-consuming preparation.
[1:46:56] <MacCaran> i never noticed
[1:46:59] <bentpigeon> @Ev3ntic thank you :) think I just slept funny so I'll be good, how are you?
[1:47:02] <TrueWm> does anyone have that clip of otz freaking out while playing dead space when he starts reading a fact from chat?
[1:47:08] <xZomboKing> Do you enjoy the new freddy ?
[1:47:10] <kiito_g> i hate clowns laugh otzFine
[1:47:12] <mike1yroshevsky> !ghost
[1:47:22] <mike1yroshevsky> !freddy
[1:47:26] <Ev3ntic> @bentpigeon aww, I'm good thanks otzLove
[1:47:32] <jkl3332> Clown laugh is the best thing ever. :x
[1:47:32] <claracake9> @kiito_g I hate the doctor's more
[1:47:51] <FengPlayz> jocely6Hi roarLove
[1:47:55] <the_outsider_x> wee woo
[1:48:00] <jeanilixg> I rather take doctor laughs than clown laughs any day
[1:48:01] <r_r_8_8_> Clown's knife animation is great.
[1:48:02] <ikar_13iq> Hey, Otz! Do u know some Rassian streamers?
[1:48:02] <ZaptronTwitch> clowns or doctors laugh what do you guys think?
[1:48:04] <EmperorBarst> PepeHands lost
[1:48:04] <mr_cosby> damn these gens are flying
[1:48:04] <kiito_g> @claracake9 dont tell me about this one
[1:48:11] <Dark_Reef> @FengPlayz Hello otzHi otzLove
[1:48:12] <rickyturtlez> Doctor laugh os better
[1:48:17] <kiito_g> PepeHands
[1:48:17] <Fails2172> doc
[1:48:18] <rickyturtlez> Is-
[1:48:24] <FengPlayz> @dark_reef roarLove hi how are you?
[1:48:27] <ispi91> not discouraging, I'd say unfair
[1:48:30] <missmeong> @Dark_Reef Why so tired? Did you not sleep well? :/ I am pretty good, thanks! I am still on vacation and can do whatever I want :)
[1:48:37] <mike1yroshevsky> !freddy
[1:48:38] <r_r_8_8_> Gens going by quickly
[1:48:45] <sickcrom_> ruin gone? gen rush
[1:48:46] <the_outsider_x> !nightmare
[1:48:47] <kiito_g> its annoying guyss
[1:48:48] <Nightbot> The Nightmare can teleport to unfinished generators to exert pressure across the map. His other abilities depend on his add-ons, and can be either fake illusory pallets or dream snares that slow down survivors on contact. To mitigate these powers, survivors must avoid falling asleep by not getting hit or waking up by failing skill checks, finding awake survivors or interacting with a certain map prop. He has an average movement speed (115%) and an alternating terror radius/song lullaby (32m).
[1:48:54] <SA_Vengarr> Do you think default generator repair speed should be nerfed?
[1:48:55] <carmine9000yeet> f
[1:49:06] <ispi91> well balanced game lol
[1:49:12] <Dark_Reef> @FengPlayz A bit tired, but good otzLove And gow are you?
[1:49:14] <Semir68> @SA_Vengarr lol its slow enough
[1:49:20] <ZaptronTwitch> you should make it that !freddy and !leatherface works too
[1:49:23] <OOM2000> Well
[1:49:23] <Gearguts> 80 sec to repair a gen is long enough
[1:49:30] <OOM2000> I know what I'll be buying tommorow
[1:49:36] <r_r_8_8_> Games like this are so disheartening
[1:49:37] <mvumnrms> in anything but red ranks 80 seconds is torture
[1:49:48] <sickcrom_> @gearguts LUL
[1:49:49] <kiito_g> everything the clown does he laughs otzFine
[1:49:55] <DuncaPunca> I really want the Xenomorph in this game. A spaceship map with maybe an eggnest
[1:49:58] <zeromanity> @zeromanity is new here. Say hello! SeemsGood
[1:50:01] <ispi91> @sa_vengarr I'd prefer a second objective, also as survivor bcs
[1:50:02] <nightknight854> maybe if everytime a gen was done all other gens can't be progressed for 20 seconds
[1:50:02] <SA_Vengarr> Mainly I think its the coordinated survivors that do the gens at light speed
[1:50:03] <FengPlayz> @dark_reef I hope you can get some rest soon. geisLove though I’m happy to know you’re doing good at least. kittyzPFT I’m doing okay, ty. primit4HUG

Id love to try it myself but I dont have the perks on the killers Id like to use and my friends never really play serious.

[2:15:07] <eneakita> donde esta la yeet
[2:15:08] <ZaptronTwitch> i feel like the shrine always has the same trash perks, unfortunately people are using always the same perks, especially on survivor because theyre just by far the best
[2:15:31] <Kitsuneternal> @twiistedsixx he did. a handful of killers did, you should check the store out later
[2:15:34] <OOM2000> I haven't had a fun match on haddonfield

[2:15:56] <Batasz> @ZaptronTwitch i think its not worth buying perks from shrine, its much better to just lvl up killers and then buy it in the shrine so u have bonus bps

[2:25:04] <yolo4ka_gamer> why didnt she died??
[2:25:05] <AnonyNoob> Wait I thought escaping with the trap on killed you
[2:25:05] <kyatistream> I thought you died if you have a trap
[2:25:06] <claracake9> You could have picked her up
[2:25:16] <jayman1777> @shadezzzz she was past the trigger already
[2:25:18] <claracake9> @yolo4ka_gamer Her trap wasnt on
[2:25:22] <Dinklebergers> the trap wasnt armed
[2:25:25] <bobrys> I feel like you could have picked her up there instead of placing a trap
[2:25:27] <AnonyNoob> Ohhhhhh gotcha
[2:25:35] <afellowbird> They recently nerfed pig and the trap only activates if a gen is done
[2:25:44] <hibiskiss> can you open hatch if you have a key? even after killer closes it?

[3:21:57] <BoldlyBadly> @Otzdarva You used an exploit where if you press M1, your killer swings their weapon and it injures the survivor unfairly.

[3:21:57] <StickySnoww> *barely gets 2 kills* Survivors: REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

[3:22:15] <content_filter> OMEGALUL
[3:22:15] <Nayowayo> you hooked a survivor when the gates were open you must have been exploiting the game LUL
[3:22:17] <TheRipper2003> On paper, GF sounds like he'd just get genrushed but in game he seems pretty good
[3:22:19] <LoneWolfenOne> !cheats
[3:22:20] <Badaba> i wish this game didnt have such toxicity tbh, the way its designed its just bound to happen though PepeHands
[3:22:20] <Nightbot> Wanna be a filthy cheater like Otz? Go to http://otzcheats.com to find out more! otzEZ
[3:22:20] <chiggiebees> Killing survivors is actually an exploit otz didn’t you see the newest patch notes?
[3:22:21] <CannonFighter29> you are an aweful killer, you used m1 when you shouldve let them all leave through the hatch Kappa
[3:22:23] <Horo_Cry> time to play a non-real killer I see
[3:22:24] <Tman_T_Hall> playing the game is a bannable offense
[3:22:26] <ViviR66> pepeL
[3:22:28] <sickcrom_> you can't kill us if we are 5 feet away from the gates, I'm calling it exploits and tunneling
[3:22:29] <Avilgus> Dark devotion on Legion OTZ ?
[3:22:30] <wicked1one> I bet you're gonna use an exploit on legion to temporarily move faster and put people into deep wounds with m1
[3:22:35] <afellowbird> I've had survivors complain and accuse me of being campy even when they've all escaped. Survivors never seem happy
[3:22:45] <Zay_The_Pharaoh> Deep wounds build?
[3:22:46] <spprince> can you play other legion members?
[3:22:46] <loading321> He is talking about kate probably @Otzdarva
[3:22:49] <genashi> DBD is a nice game but it can make you feel bad sometimes
[3:22:50] <RayMan1020> cheer5 90% of survivors do nothing but bitch and whine for little to no reason at all. Its so annoying and the fact this community is so whiney is the one thing about this game that sucks
[3:22:52] <Zay_The_Pharaoh> OOOOOO

[3:24:13] <sickcrom_> survivor mains streamers are so fucking retarded i swear, the hide the other half of the game, make killers look jokes and easy to play
[3:24:14] <genashi> People miss the point of the game... If you're a survivor, you need to struggle to escape not be able to do it easy.

[3:25:23] <KrazyBigJ> neat.
[3:25:29] <afellowbird> imo a survivor game is usually more fun if you have some difficulty. otherwise it's just holding m1 for a few minutes and that's it

[3:36:02] <x3mSlayer> those chainsaws that didnt hit cost the match
[3:36:20] <kantishko> Mistake 1: taking pop.
[3:36:21] <googleson78> @Otzdarva which survivor perk do you despise the most? which perk do you think is designed very well?
[3:36:27] <TarQuinn> Displeased
[3:36:28] <x3mSlayer> 2 in a row missed PwpwHands
[3:36:29] <skaviana> entity displeased?
[3:36:31] <drmanco443> i guess you missed a couple crucial chainsaw hits near the end
[3:36:32] <DhamianDoode> Mistake 1: Whispers
[3:36:38] <r_r_8_8_> Entity is a moody bitch
[3:36:38] <KabokuXO> its so hard with billy to get some points in "chases" ._ .
[3:36:39] <monpetitvomito> maybe the mistake is to use too much his power instead of M1 sometimes (near windows)
[3:36:40] <sevenvader2> thats why i gonna main nurse - the only killer who feels like killer not like some scooby doo villian
[3:36:44] <testohr> 24k and not good what
[3:36:47] <xtheboyduddus> survivor?
[3:36:56] <Camo_720> billu not as good as he used to be
[3:36:57] <chiggiebees> D A M N
[3:37:01] <sevenvader2> After i got usefull perks on her
[3:37:26] <ELIGOS0> "Diminister" what?
[3:37:30] <skaviana> borrowed vs decisive?
[3:37:34] <googleson78> one, nothing wrong with me
[3:37:34] <x36granitplatte> Is it sometimes a good idea to ignore survivors when it takes too long, and put some trapps ?? (trapper)
[3:37:37] <TarQuinn> @sevenvader2 You can also never rank up past purple and you will be fine unless they smurf with sfw
[3:37:45] <Nightowl579> @otzdarva help me how to i escape from 80% humidity
[3:37:49] <agentdanis64> we hiccuped together otz this is insane
[3:37:50] <TheLoneLamp> OoO is just for party griefing, it's awful otherwise
[3:37:53] <TheNemDu33> bubba has the same add ons as billy ?
[3:37:54] <renegadecop50> object of obsession is fundamentally broken
[3:37:56] <r_r_8_8_> Adrenaline: the NOED of survivor perks?
[3:37:59] <Dinklebergers> @Otzdarva is there a perk that can replace discordance in the bubba build from todays video?
[3:38:00] <ryujisayingfor_real> otzMAD
[3:38:14] <the_one_lascivious> i think ds should have a lower timer to simply just be a tunnel counter. now you can let them go, chase someone else and still get ds'd by that guy
[3:38:23] <agentdanis64> Otz wanna see my freddie mercury sculpture
[3:38:24] <akuuseru0> ds + délivrance op
[3:38:33] <agentdanis64> is there a discord?
[3:38:39] <gtowelies> n werd
[3:38:57] <sickcrom_> Otz sorry for the generalization, I just can't stand swf that's like "flashlight lol" "epic unbreakable borrowed time decisive strike insta heal and adrenaline save" "ahah lol get genruehed" and meanwhile the killer is swearing his ass off not to depip
[3:38:59] <jnius_> !discrod
[3:39:02] <Kumakx> well but that requires you NOT TO get hooked during the WHOLE game
[3:39:05] <sevenvader2> @TarQuinn yeah that is nice too but i think its kinda hillarious if you realize that freddy - Master of nightmares in movies is scared of pallet in game xD
[3:39:07] <jnius_> !discord

[3:39:27] <zuha91> Finally!
[3:39:27] <M3lonade> how about some wraith gameplay?
[3:39:29] <znxeverything> huntress main otz
[3:39:31] <xtheboyduddus> survivor?
[3:39:32] <r_r_8_8_> Hag next maybe?
[3:39:32] <Mad_Johan> !ghostface
[3:39:33] <Nightbot> The Ghost Face can hide his presence and stalk each survivor to potentially one-shot them, as long as he's not seen. When not in stealth mode, he has an average movement speed (115%) and terror radius (32m).
[3:39:34] <afellowbird> imagine using decisive when flip flop, a much better perk in every single way, exists otzMAD
[3:39:52] <the_one_lascivious> Do you play hag at all, i don't think i've ever seen you play her :(
[3:39:56] <Kumakx> How about slowing killer regression on gens but also slowing down survivor progress on them? would make games longer
[3:40:07] <claracake9> @zmaestoso 16% is not that big of a deal
[3:40:12] <StickySnoww> hag game inconPOG

[3:40:34] <Alegorn6> Hi @WolfTheSkeleton
[3:40:34] <snarklog> add a point cap, with major perks having a high point value, and lesser perks having lower scores, or even score reductions to encourage underused perks maybe?

[3:53:39] <frostbyte2068> @otzdarva What legion addons would you recommend?
[3:53:43] <TK_the_Onion> a killer whose projectiles reload without having to consistently go to a particular location/slow down would be so greatr
[3:53:44] <xxDevaLxx> Otz, what are your thoughts on TRUFFLEBUTTER?
[3:53:46] <jotrizona> How have the matches been going @otzdarva
[3:53:47] <afellowbird> @sa_vengarr I think there was some glitch somewhere where that did actually happen
[3:53:49] <sscarvenger> still gonna get acussed of tunneling probably
[3:53:49] <RODIONEX> Just tried stealthy doc, it's freaking amazing
[3:53:55] <waltzqueen> thanks for the huntress game!
[3:53:57] <TarQuinn> @ThugRammus I mean the stuttering of the screen. freezes happen in some frequency in Backwater Swamp maps but i didnt notice anything else happening in my game

[3:54:15] <TearyMov> Hatchets Going Through Survivors So If They Line Up, They can hit multiple survivors hashHa
[3:54:16] <visnja_pevec> did you play bubba?
[3:54:17] <ThugRammus> alright
[3:54:31] <p0r0ngasaurio> the proper way to play this game is with low settings
[3:54:31] <JaeRoar> vsync is always on I think, its in the files
[3:54:32] <stardawgz> its in the gameusersettings in the files
[3:54:34] <TarQuinn> You would need to change it in gamefiles @Otzdarva
[3:54:34] <HopeEst> You have to disable VSync in a file
[3:54:35] <Lightpino> Vsync can only be disabled in files
[3:54:36] <gadrus> vsync setting are only in config file iirc
[3:54:37] <cauchemarel> @Otzdarva you have Vsync on because the game is running in virtual fullscreen
[3:54:39] <KoKov> Honestly I read it as ‘I blew my son’
[3:54:39] <Voxyld> isn't v-sync deactivable only in the files ?
[3:54:40] <ScoutWalker> geefPeep
[3:54:42] <sscarvenger> vsync is in the files
[3:54:46] <ELIGOS0> Otz has poofed V-sync out of existence
[3:54:47] <CannonFighter29> could you play bubba otz?
[3:54:47] <Masterman71> graphics on low is the way to go
[3:54:49] <TarQuinn> And you can use your 144 hz monitor that way
[3:54:54] <hassliebe69> There's config in game files.
[3:54:54] <wicked1one> @kokov same and I had a concern
[3:54:56] <r_r_8_8_> Hag game?
[3:54:59] <TarQuinn> YES
[3:55:03] <TarQuinn> It is huge
[3:55:04] <numbscar> Yes
[3:55:09] <gadrus> it would allow for 60+ fps too
[3:55:10] <numbscar> v sync is ass
[3:55:10] <JumpFaFnir> Wow that is Loud.
[3:55:10] <M3lonade> how about wraith
[3:55:11] <chocoscape> do I have time to make food before you play that legion game?

[3:55:37] <NegativeZero64> @Otzdarva the config is under appdata
[3:55:38] <stardawgz> its in the gameusersettings, appdata, turn usevsync off and set a new fps cap
[3:55:39] <Renholder_> You better look for a guide on how to disable v-sync and remove FPS cap
[3:55:42] <Renholder_> Its kinda tricky

[3:58:13] <TK_the_Onion> only good thing about cornfield is that there is so much corn to hide traps in. the bad thing about so much corn: since there's so much corn, it's hard to find a good corn spot to put a corn trap in it, making it difficult to find a good corn spot

[4:05:58] <dr4g0vt> otz did u pip ?
[4:06:01] <saw_conn> mad grit?
[4:06:01] <sleazera> LUL the lokes ECKS DEE
[4:06:04] <Spiteful_Malice> going off to bed. Cya Otz
[4:06:15] <JaeRoar> Yeah man, always down roarYes
[4:06:19] <afellowbird> why not use add ons that make it harder to escape from traps???
[4:06:20] <wicked1one> Trapper add on that makes traps only visibly within X range
[4:06:23] <dropalive_> whoa dude you look just like this guy Not Otzdarva that I been watching on yt
[4:06:24] <p0r0ngasaurio> bbq is useless in all killers actually (survivors know how to counter it) still is a farming point machine and you need points so.
[4:06:25] <TarQuinn> Wanna try to change the vsync or will you do it offsteam? @otz I don't want to be too persistant so I don't annoy you and the chat
[4:06:34] <proceratium> Anyone who's in school does your summer break end next week?
[4:06:34] <kantishko> If you want points, then just use monsterous shrine.
[4:06:35] <r_r_8_8_> YEYEYE
[4:06:41] <Ench1> SPIRIT
[4:06:41] <ZaptronTwitch> just came back playing trapper aigan? you seem to really like the new skin i surely like the body

[4:06:59] <dropalive_> @zombieaids8675309 👀
[4:07:00] <numbscar> hag is so good
[4:07:01] <furutsu> @otzdarv awhen are we playing fighting games
[4:07:03] <x36granitplatte> Is it a good idea chasing a guy for minutes and cant put trapps meanwhile as trapper ??
[4:07:05] <stardawgz> @Otzdarva te quiero
[4:07:07] <furutsu> shit i fucked that up
[4:07:09] <Deathborr> Otz just because you play Trapper doesn’t mean you can keep your child in the basement. Let him out and please pay the child support
[4:07:09] <sleazera> BIG THONK
[4:07:10] <eelcozy> I've been watching this Korean dude that plays Rank 1 killer, it's kind of interesting to see the Korean DBD meta
[4:07:11] <Dragonexer1> "kill survivors by your own hand" is the most toxic daily lol. literally the devs telling you to tilt people
[4:07:14] <p0r0ngasaurio> agitation hag is nasty and powerfull
[4:07:14] <ScoutWalker> hex roulette is my fave
[4:07:17] <cyanlavalamp> Are you able to play nurse?
[4:07:17] <Otzdarva> !so TerasuHikari
[4:07:18] <Nightbot> Check this wonderful person out at https://www.twitch.tv/TerasuHikari and give them a follow!
[4:07:21] <saw_conn> a perk build with only obsession claws on perks? @Otzdarva
[4:07:26] <Lunnefisk> harry book is the best fighting game player out there PogChamp

[4:07:34] <saw_conn> gg ez
[4:07:35] <ScoutWalker> yeah PogChamp
[4:07:35] <zenveto> your english is very good my friend @otzdarva
[4:07:38] <p0r0ngasaurio> one of the best maps you can get for her
[4:07:39] <r_r_8_8_> Otz playing Guilty Gear would be a sight to see
[4:07:43] <TarQuinn> @ScoutWalker I'll stop then. be sure to remind him later if you can direct message him for me :p
[4:07:44] <renegadecop50> germans are confirmed awesome
[4:07:50] <zerosmelody> Has anything been bothering you Otz? If you ever feel like life is difficult it’s okay to vent a little. We all appreciate your kindness.
[4:07:52] <SA_Vengarr> Oh god, this is Hag central
[4:07:54] <epicgamermom420> Dying Light and Furtive Chase 5Head 5Head 5Head#
[4:07:54] <eelcozy> @schmogmog3 they both have good perks, go for it
[4:08:14] <kazuyaman171> proxycamp confirmed? @otzdarva
[4:08:17] <TarQuinn> @renegadecop50 I have heard that somwhere around 1930 :p
[4:08:19] <M__lady> Gamer time
[4:08:22] <p0r0ngasaurio> save the best for last is kinda useless for hag
[4:08:23] <MergingMist> No more hag just got againts 2 and now i see you playing her MiniK
[4:08:25] <p0r0ngasaurio> imo
[4:08:28] <proceratium> Smash ultimate has a very op character who can insta kill you whenever and I think that's bs
[4:08:31] <ScoutWalker> @TarQuinn if you dm him on discord he will probably see it! he does a pretty good job of responding to his dms!
[4:08:34] <CannonFighter29> who should i get first, freddy, or vommy mommy?
[4:08:43] <x36granitplatte> full urban squad incomin KappaPride
[4:08:48] <renegadecop50> @TarQuinn hey man im saying that shit in 2019 im like carrying on our traditions
[4:08:50] <bentpigeon> Oh man I wanna watch stream but I so wanna play some DS2
[4:08:52] <ScoutWalker> sluuuuuuuuuuuuuuurp
[4:08:53] <TarQuinn> @ScoutWalker ok thanks i'll do that then
[4:08:55] <eMpathyQuaKe> zubMEG
[4:09:01] <ScoutWalker> @TarQuinn mintsLove
[4:09:03] <schmogmog3> i am unsure to level bill or claudette next @eelcozy
[4:09:03] <gorgonzola95> I always spam ctrl as Hag if I know they are running into one of my traps
[4:09:04] <p0r0ngasaurio> mint rag + myc= GG
[4:09:08] <Dragonexer1> basementface is my favorite
[4:09:16] <TK_the_Onion> @CannonFighter29 plague is harder because her main power is reliant on survivors while freddy, who has been reworked, is much easier to learn and play for newer players
[4:09:20] <proceratium> @bentpigeon you gotta multi-task
[4:09:27] <rickyturtlez> Do you have bodyblock add on?
[4:09:30] <epicgamermom420> Leatherface requires Insidious and addons while Hag can just use her base power to camp basement
[4:09:30] <renegadecop50> hags ability to be just kinda everywhere is why i love her
[4:09:31] <ninesnoir> where would you tier hag
[4:09:33] <CannonFighter29> @tk_the_onion thank you for the advice
[4:09:39] <bentpigeon> @proceratium I normally do, but my 2nd monitor stopped working otsSad
[4:09:42] <bentpigeon> otzSad
[4:09:44] <Lunnefisk> pigeon yeah turn otz into a podcast
[4:09:44] <gorgonzola95> Bodyblock Hag is garbage
[4:09:47] <SA_Vengarr> That teleport play!
[4:09:47] <saw_conn> POg
[4:09:48] <r_r_8_8_> Fucking 4d chess
[4:09:52] <ScoutWalker> murder HandsUp
[4:09:56] <proceratium> @bentpigeon F
[4:09:56] <p0r0ngasaurio> this is gg alrady
[4:10:05] <wicked1one> Hag STILL makes me squeak in surprise and stuff, despite playing over a year now
[4:10:07] <Lunnefisk> i never know who the nurse is and i always think this is nurse
[4:10:10] <Lunnefisk> hey nightbot who's the nurse
[4:10:11] <Lunnefisk> !nurse
[4:10:12] <Nightbot> The Nurse uses her power to warp around the map and through any object. She has an average terror radius (32m) but a very reduce movement speed (96%) when she's not using her power. Her ability to chase regardless of the environment makes her the strongest Killer in the game.
[4:10:15] <saw_conn> isnt hag best on console?
[4:10:18] <gorgonzola95> @wicked1one same here
[4:10:23] <dokk_k> i love the hag
[4:10:34] <MergingMist> Hag are stupid strong
[4:10:41] <Linn__> basement party LULW
[4:10:47] <bentpigeon> @Lunnefisk but then I can't see you beautiful people
[4:10:51] <saw_conn> game
[4:10:51] <oddree> nice sandbag otzGLAD
[4:10:51] <SmokySunshine> :O
[4:10:53] <p0r0ngasaurio> gg
[4:11:04] <bentpigeon> PARTYYY
[4:11:05] <Sporkorino> if she didnt pop that would have been game
[4:11:09] <gorgonzola95> Hag's basement = GG
[4:11:09] <TK_the_Onion> so i'd say freddy @CannonFighter29 Only problem is that freddy is Licensed, so he costs actual money, and the survivor he comes with is terrible, as well as both of their perks. Plague has some good perks, including Infectious fright, which otz uses alot, and the survivor who comes with plague has Headon, a meme perk. But plague can be earned for free with iridescent shards
[4:11:18] <chocoscape> Hi YouTube!!!!!!
[4:11:20] <p0r0ngasaurio> hag underrated
[4:11:35] <Lunnefisk> do you think hag deserves a nerf, or is she in the right place
[4:11:38] <ScoutWalker> i like the goop sound that is made
[4:11:39] <renegadecop50> hag mad underrated
[4:11:43] <Voxyld> STBFL otzSAD
[4:11:44] <StratSZN> hi youtube!
[4:11:44] <r_r_8_8_> Hag is fantastic
[4:11:51] <p0r0ngasaurio> the first time i went to rank 1 was due hag i never understood why she is so underrated
[4:11:52] <gliscor76> hiii
[4:11:52] <gorgonzola95> with 5 gens you don;t even use your power anymore
[4:11:53] <wicked1one> Hag was made for this map
[4:11:55] <rickyturtlez> Basement game is brutal
[4:11:56] <MysticVane> untill someone has a flashlight
[4:11:57] <Lunnefisk> 5 gens and 2k otzGreed
[4:11:59] <ScoutWalker> @gliscor76 geefHi
[4:11:59] <DhamianDoode> @p0r0ngasaurio true words
[4:12:00] <proceratium> I think hag is a little bit too good
[4:12:04] <Alegorn6> I really like this hang
[4:12:06] <ScoutWalker> gooooooooop
[4:12:07] <gorgonzola95> BBQ makes no sense on Hag, I guess it's for points?
[4:12:08] <M__lady> Now thats gamer time
[4:12:10] <saw_conn> i just trap around ruin and they almost always try to cleanse before working on gens
[4:12:12] <numbscar> rusty shackles imagine
[4:12:14] <p0r0ngasaurio> the game and this map are nasty for hag
[4:12:15] <SA_Vengarr> Does that Map add-on reveal Hag traps? I am too blind to notice them until it's too late
[4:12:17] <eelcozy> Hag isn't too good, gets countered by flashlight/urban
[4:12:18] <ConfusedHemorrhoid> I'm not even a great killer but i feel bad using hag most games
[4:12:26] <p0r0ngasaurio> imagien you use agitation with hag is jsut not okay LOL
[4:12:27] <renegadecop50> hag can make enemy strengths into weaknesses too well lol
[4:12:28] <Geckker> why would you need ruin if they don't have a chance to do gens haHAA
[4:12:32] <r_r_8_8_> pI wouldn't be surprised if they d/c'd at this point
[4:12:33] <six_skullsz> eyy Otz hi
[4:12:42] <gorgonzola95> Urban Evasion doesn't even counter Hag
[4:12:51] <wicked1one> She struggles some on bigger maps if survivors aren't dumb
[4:12:55] <epicgamermom420> No one uses a flashlight on traps unless they're being toxic lol
[4:13:10] <DhamianDoode> @gorgonzola95 you dont activate the Traps. Yes it counters
[4:13:12] <renegadecop50> true most people dont even bother
[4:13:13] <eelcozy> that's fair
[4:13:15] <gorgonzola95> The only real threat to Hag is a person with OoO and a flashligt
[4:13:22] <gorgonzola95> @DhamianDoode how can you crouch when she finds you?
[4:13:24] <zerosmelody> What’s Good youtube!
[4:13:25] <Lunnefisk> are there precisely 5 gens or are there more
[4:13:29] <x_nirvana> Object is bad for hag
[4:13:34] <bentpigeon> normally 7 @Lunnefisk
[4:13:34] <Linn__> what do you think of a hag with Rusty Shackles+Grandma's heart otz? Kapp
[4:13:36] <ScoutWalker> @Lunnefisk there are 7 iirc
[4:13:40] <TK_the_Onion> flashlights aren't that great of a cripple to hag compared to an insta heal
[4:13:42] <renegadecop50> OoO and a flash will counter basically most people tho lol
[4:13:47] <SashaJen> A person with a torch is a free hit every time you wait a few seconds after downing someone.
[4:13:53] <DhamianDoode> @gorgonzola95 not in Hunt
[4:13:54] <p0r0ngasaurio> she is jsut like a way better trapper
[4:13:54] <skill4jon> @Otzdarva I am alive ikr
[4:13:56] <ninesnoir> i had a hag with ruin and devour, we dropped like flies
[4:13:56] <Dragonexer1> you could have flashlight against a killer that ignores palettes and therefore will almost never get blinded, or you could bring a commodius or a good medkit.
[4:14:00] <x36granitplatte> what are optical survivors ?
[4:14:01] <renegadecop50> this claudette hags
[4:14:06] <oddree> this claudette is nailing the trap dead hards
[4:14:14] <gorgonzola95> @DhamianDoode she will find you eventually, just like Huntress can find you
[4:14:30] <DhamianDoode> @gorgonzola95 who would try that^^ but still Hag is my Fav Killer..
[4:14:33] <Geckker> poor survivors
[4:14:45] <ScoutWalker> PepePls
[4:14:49] <gliscor76> hi I've been folowing your Yt channel for a really long time
[4:15:01] <Christor> What’s bad about urban evasion @otzdarva
[4:15:03] <oddree> @gliscor76 otzLove welcome to the stream
[4:15:05] <Geckker> PepePls
[4:15:09] <renegadecop50> rare to see hag without monitor
[4:15:12] <DhamianDoode> @gorgonzola95 I main Hag...when all SWF run Urban, they can be anoying, but you are right, still find them and eat their Liver...
[4:15:15] <ScoutWalker> got some good music playing at work PepePls
[4:15:17] <Dragonexer1> did they make the hatch spawn earlier now?
[4:15:23] <visnja_pevec> bbq woould be useful
[4:15:27] <TrueWm> i thought this was the beggining of a game because i just came back then looked at the amount dead
[4:15:27] <oddree> @Christor almost a waste of a perk slot, you could use something much better instead of urban
[4:15:32] <stardawgz> SSSsss SSSsss SSSsss SSSsss
[4:15:32] <proceratium> @scoutwalker what type of music?
[4:15:33] <x36granitplatte> @renegadecop50 Its not really needed on hag.
[4:15:36] <Kumakx> @visnja_pevec he has bbq
[4:15:39] <r_r_8_8_> "That's so fucked up" Describes ths game perfectly
[4:15:42] <PastimeRemembrance> What's the good music? otzWow @ScoutWalker
[4:15:49] <SA_Vengarr> STBFL doesn't seem all that necessary for Hag
[4:15:52] <renegadecop50> @x36granitplatte do agree, just found it interesting
[4:15:55] <ScoutWalker> @proceratium some chill stuff but its nice @PastimeRemembrance some stuff i can vibe with
[4:16:01] <dokk_k> why not i use it on all my killers is a must have perk
[4:16:11] <doinkoes> Is crouchwalking with urban evasion faster than walking normally?
[4:16:18] <dokk_k> gens go way to quick to not use it
[4:16:19] <gliscor76> @oddree hi and thank you
[4:16:25] <QuasarEV> Hey Otz I just arrived, can you show me the skin later please?
[4:16:26] <PastimeRemembrance> Pog vibe with PepePls
[4:16:26] <Dragonexer1> otz wants the attack wind-down time so that he can teleport after a hit as soon as possible
[4:16:27] <ArtoTime45> @Christor Crouching faster, doesn't help, like at all. Crouching whilst standing still usually does it. It isn't the worst perk, but it certainly isn't worth a perk slot. imo, the perk is around C tier at best
[4:16:28] <renegadecop50> ruin is definitely worth running basically all the time tho, way too good
[4:16:30] <x36granitplatte> @renegadecop50 yah. forgot to mention: "at my opinion"
[4:16:32] <oddree> @doinkoes no, they are the same speed
[4:16:32] <otzs_manservant> dragon
[4:16:36] <proceratium> Oo I personally listen most to Sabaton and Amaranthe
[4:16:38] <otzs_manservant> nvm brb

[4:18:13] <dokk_k> why :(
[4:18:14] <ArtoTime45> was there a good reason for removing the grab survivors off of the hatch? My 1 month break was during the end game collapse update, so I don't know if the devs said anything
[4:18:16] <Prepure_Kaede> if she doesnt want it just kill her
[4:18:22] <M3lonade> she's unworthy
[4:18:25] <zombieaids8675309> should have just killed her
[4:18:27] <M__lady> gamer time :/
[4:18:28] <dokk_k> kill no mercy :p
[4:18:33] <r_r_8_8_> "He's walking past all these hooks, he surely means to kill me"

[4:19:03] <Wubsyy__> I've been getting nothing but Haddonfield while playing killer. It's the only map I have an issue with as killer. Do any of you have any tips to help me on it? Or do I just need to git gud?
[4:19:06] <gliscor76> you can't grab them now if they try to escape for the hatch since the endgame update
[4:19:07] <genashi> You should never struggle if you're the last one left
[4:19:08] <JumpFaFnir> She is not nice with us.
[4:19:09] <x36granitplatte> Daddy: Nah we'll give her a chance :-). Trap triggered: She's dead.
[4:19:11] <M3lonade> do what you must
[4:19:15] <Last_L> No sorry otzMAD
[4:19:16] <CreatorTH> PLEASE THE ENTITY
[4:19:17] <joshua_01889> she resisted thats a sin punishable by death

[4:27:22] <dbdbuildsyt> yes Legion after lease?
[4:27:23] <ScoutWalker> give clown a ripstik
[4:27:26] <oddree> @r_r_8_8_ definitely not
[4:27:30] <hiccup16> LOL
[4:27:31] <genashi> How long it takes for bloodlust to trigger?
[4:27:32] <Spiriet_dragon> what this bottle does?
[4:27:34] <TearyMov> Do that guys idea but instead of a regular scooter give clown a fat guy mobility Scooter hashHa
[4:27:36] <ArtoTime45> After the nerf to having a good time, my brain switched to become an anxiety main. Such a boring thing to main.
[4:27:44] <Surrevalla> holy shit clown on a segway
[4:27:47] <oddree> @Spiriet_dragon you can throw the bottles to slow down survivors
[4:27:47] <hibiskiss> !clown
[4:27:48] <Nightbot> The Clown throws bottles to create gas clouds that slow down any survivors in them. He has an average movement speed (115%) and terror radius (32m). Although he can stop survivors from looping, he still needs to put in the work to make that count.
[4:28:01] <ScoutWalker> clown with roller skates tho
[4:28:03] <lazza_> @proceratium dont worry my dude i have 5 insane demons in acc
[4:28:04] <TearyMov> !spirit
[4:28:04] <Nightbot> The Spirit phases into an alternate dimension, where she can't see or be seen by survivors, only to quickly reappear at a new spot. When not phasing, she has a reduced movement speed (110%) and a small terror radius (24m). Her ability to mind-game survivors in almost any situation makes her one of the strongest Killers in the game.
[4:28:07] <hibiskiss> @Spiriet_dragon it slows down survivors
[4:28:08] <r_r_8_8_> @oddree He can reload on the move, is faster and has no aoe song giving her away.
[4:28:13] <rustinvelcoro> wait what
[4:28:15] <Parisuwu> Give clown his own clown car that he can use and come out of a locker so he actually looks like a clown coming out of something ridiculous
[4:28:24] <Dan_PC> What was this aura, is this Object of Obsession?
[4:28:25] <Mad_Johan> !clown
[4:28:26] <Nightbot> The Clown throws bottles to create gas clouds that slow down any survivors in them. He has an average movement speed (115%) and terror radius (32m). Although he can stop survivors from looping, he still needs to put in the work to make that count.
[4:28:34] <numbscar> clown car buahahaha LUL
[4:28:53] <oddree> @r_r_8_8_ but clown's shots don't do damage unless you're running the ultra-rare addon
[4:29:10] <Badaba> its mad demotivating for new people for sure though PepeHands

[4:29:16] <QuasarEV> @numbscar the little car with 10 of his friends inside LUL
[4:29:17] <TrueWm> !shape
[4:29:17] <Nightbot> The Shape stares at survivors to build up his power. He starts out slow and stealthy and later moves on to gain an average speed (115%) and a reduced terror radius (16m). When fully powered, he can one-shot survivors temporarily.

[4:29:33] <ConfusedHemorrhoid> theres a lot to grind for but enough good stuff is unlocked pretty quickly
[4:29:33] <otzs_manservant> @oddree they don't damage even with pinky :^) they apply Exposed which allows instadowns

[4:29:47] <TrueWm> @cauchemarel yeah, that happens alot

[4:36:31] <DetectivePickle> @jake_nurilov Shameless Purple Haze is just writing, so if you like reading it's great
[4:36:34] <proceratium> But one thing I line about Otz is that he pays the same ammount of attention to subs and non subs
[4:36:40] <proceratium> *like
[4:36:46] <PatchySouls> is it just me, or is the 60fps not coming across as 60fps for me?
[4:36:50] <Badaba> whispers absolutely countered that strategy luckily

[4:37:08] <bentpigeon> @proceratium He doesn't pay any attention to mods otzSAD
[4:37:11] <r_r_8_8_> Scorpion as a killer - "Get over here"
[4:37:11] <cauchemarel> Is there any possibility Dying Light and DbD are doing a collab? That discount everyone got was pretty random, lol
[4:37:12] <DeathArcanalll> Otz, just played against a small streamer that lag switched at the end game to kill me since i looped him for 4 gens, he was on live do you thing he gonna get banned for that?
[4:37:14] <bartholom3ow> what is the state of clown besides your god plays?
[4:37:15] <QuasarEV> How about a rain related killer? With thunders maybe Pog
[4:37:15] <LinkMorgan> Favourite stand Otz?
[4:37:18] <MarioScipio> Next killer will be that monster from Tremors monkaS
[4:37:20] <knivedm> Best clown game I’ve seen in a while. He seems so weak
[4:37:23] <uniquemanchild> the killers name could be Jim Halberd
[4:37:27] <uniquemanchild> get it?!
[4:37:28] <TM4N_> Question new to the game, do you have to play certain killers to unlock specific perks or can you just play one and obtain all? I was reading the wiki and from what it appears you have to hit at least 35 on specific hunters to obtain specific perks to use on other hunters.

[4:41:57] <Kitsuneternal> !wraith
[4:41:57] <thecrashkid10> I love the bone clacker plus the brown one that suppresses terror radius for six seconds
[4:41:58] <Nightbot> The Wraith uses his bell to turn almost invisible and move faster while he masks his presence. When not cloaked, he has an average terror radius (32m) and movement speed (115%). His efficiency at finding survivors and catching them off-guard is his main strength, but he has no other tools to assist him in a chase.
[4:42:00] <rickyturtlez> Kick pallets fast
[4:42:00] <zombieaids8675309> give me those hitboxes as killer please BHVR
[4:42:03] <cauchemarel> @DaBoss36000 I'm fairly sure Otz released a video with "common builds" for killers fairly recently, you might want to see that one
[4:42:14] <lichy_popo> @DaBoss36000 I was instructed to use whispers, bbq, spirit fury, and ruin
[4:42:15] <ConfusedHemorrhoid> I struggle with myers too, always feels like they rush gens way too quickly while I'm trying to level up
[4:42:16] <DaBoss36000> k thx
[4:42:18] <otzs_manservant> @Dan_PC stacks if you run it together with add-ons for cloaked pallet kick; he's an m1 killer with garbage (for loops) ability, so it makes a lot of sense
[4:42:29] <lichy_popo> also maybe enduring

[4:48:45] <cauchemarel> @Xerakor it's supposed to eliminate screen tearing. But if your machine can't maintain 60 FPS it will drop you right to 30
[4:48:56] <Dragonexer1> vsync fixes screen tearing, the lines on a screen you see sometimes. it causes stutter though

[4:49:49] <Totalimus> Has BBQ perk ever been in the shrine since it's release, does anyone know?
[4:49:51] <proceratium> Do it to em
[4:49:57] <r_r_8_8_> lel
[4:50:11] <ArtoTime45> @Totalimus It has only been in the shrine 2 times, ever
[4:50:11] <lichy_popo> @that1mexican6969 he does, but he usually ends up enraging killers
[4:50:16] <r_r_8_8_> Nice pj's
[4:50:26] <ZRemmington> @Otzdarva I have no clue about the strat's and builds of this game, I don't even play it but you always make it fun to watch. Thanks Otz
[4:50:32] <Kitsuneternal> I think DBD itself has some known memory leak issues and if it's been running for a while it will lose performance in some areas
[4:50:56] <cauchemarel> @TarQuinn I honestly can't be sure how good the optimization is in DbD, but this might be one of the cases I would think
[4:50:56] <TK_the_Onion> Otz, you've been tricked, you've been betrayed, and, quite possibly, you've been bamboozled
[4:50:58] <Xerakor> ormond

[5:01:34] <annigator_> !cannibal
[5:01:35] <Nightbot> The Cannibal swings his chainsaw around and is capable of downing multiple survivors with it. He has an average movement speed (115%) and terror radius (32m). Although his arsenal is a bit lacking, he can still punish mistakes very harshly.
[5:01:36] <cauchemarel> @mohisdead I swear it looks like he lands m1 on some killers much easier than on the others

[5:01:46] <IamKaz> !Shape
[5:01:46] <Nightbot> The Shape stares at survivors to build up his power. He starts out slow and stealthy and later moves on to gain an average speed (115%) and a reduced terror radius (16m). When fully powered, he can one-shot survivors temporarily.

[5:15:45] <Cabbagecrocodile> @Toa_Ignika thats a common misconception. The current otz that is streaming now is actually the guy who stole the original otz's face, and this is pretty much much why he doesnt upload to the first channel anymore. maybe the original otz still lives inside the basement?

[5:20:51] <Lunnefisk> idk if i'd prefer like a 'blasting through soil' effect when she does that or keep the blatant Out of Bounds Clipping
[5:20:59] <Lunnefisk> hmmmm maybe so
[5:21:02] <lichy_popo> cool
[5:21:03] <teemoauu> Otz do you think becoming a nurse Main and Start to learning her is worth?

[5:22:05] <blaz1ngfatal1ty> Nurse and Huntress are challenging for me because i can play all other killers to a fair level with controller...
[5:22:07] <Lunnefisk> Pog 🍪🍪🍪
[5:22:09] <teemoauu> So What u think about picking trapper first for example??
[5:22:10] <waltzqueen> Cutting bangs? Otz is a stylist
[5:22:20] <hohapedyhaphap> except billy since billy can one shot, which is better than nurse @waltzqueen

[5:23:15] <MadMavericc> @NocturnalPie no it just means he's within 24m of one of the hooked survivors
[5:23:21] <Floofyboy> why u dont use ruins
[5:23:21] <darkgareth01> otz is a beatiful killer <3
[5:23:24] <randerson2011> why is discordance 1 better than 3? what changes?
[5:23:37] <friendlyrichard> friendlyrichard subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[5:23:39] <gorgonzola95> @Floofyboy Ruin on Nurse is kinda overkill
[5:23:49] <cauchemarel> @randerson2011 notifications pop more often, according to otz himself
[5:23:50] <MadMavericc> @randerson2011 it activates every 8 seconds at tier 1 and 12 seconds at tier 3, so at tier 1 it activates more often
[5:23:51] <NocturnalPie> @MadMavericc ah but it was still greyed out when all he was near to was 3 downed survivors lol, guess it was just a glitch
[5:23:59] <DuCouteauFamily> @randerson2011 You get more often the notification that they are still on it.
[5:24:04] <Geeeep> wat

[5:25:24] <hohapedyhaphap> nice
[5:25:28] <TrueWm> @ShapedWhisper welcome otzHi
[5:25:38] <loius_joe> is there even a way to run away from this killer once youve been spotted
[5:25:47] <King_Jasen> Why don’t they nerf nurse? She’s been OP for awhile now, right)
[5:25:49] <King_Jasen> *?
[5:25:59] <darkgareth01> wtf is on the nurse weapon thingy?
[5:26:00] <TrueWm> I think they just need to rework her addons
[5:26:06] <MadMavericc> a lot of people would complain @King_Jasen
[5:26:07] <sub_her0> pepeLaugh they don't know
[5:26:16] <DuCouteauFamily> @TrueWm They are actually reworking her addons right now :D
[5:26:17] <waltzqueen> @darkgareth01 its a rose. it's part of the Phantom of the ppera cosmetic
[5:26:20] <toxic_david_king> hi big fan
[5:26:22] <xmstrikeout> hey otz x) I was wondering if you have any tips on how to not lose a chase? Especially with nurse I seem to just lose the person at some point. I have almost 2k hours at survivor so I at least think I'm decent at prediction the survivor's movement, but then I lose them anyways.. so how do you do it?
[5:26:29] <cauchemarel> @King_Jasen is there a way to nerf her without destroying her, though? I don't even know how would you nerf a killer like this
[5:26:30] <gorgonzola95> Nurse's mori is so good
[5:26:32] <Floofyboy> tbh with 0 addons hes still doing too well
[5:26:41] <blaz1ngfatal1ty> damn that totem is in a nasty spot
[5:26:42] <BearackObama> ResidentSleeper time to sleep
[5:26:47] <blaz1ngfatal1ty> doubt people even go there alot
[5:26:50] <M3lonade> its a not-so-scary-bonesaw
[5:26:50] <MadMavericc> the only thing that needs to be nerfed about the nurse is her lunge, it seems pretty long
[5:26:55] <toxic_david_king> nurse? your clearly playing nea
[5:26:56] <TrueWm> you do need a lot of skill to be really good as nurse with no addons though
[5:27:02] <frostneir_games> dang dude they got wrekt
[5:27:04] <King_Jasen> @cauchemarel can’t teleport through walls? The distance she travels and ignoring pallets is good enough
[5:27:15] <MadMavericc> @TrueWm not when you master her, then she's really easy to play
[5:27:19] <friendlyrichard> how to nerf the nurse? buff other killers
[5:27:33] <whereispoor> Toxic nurse Kappa
[5:27:33] <loius_joe> whispers tracking otzBrain
[5:27:35] <cauchemarel> @King_Jasen oof, no. That sounds pretty unfun to say the least, imo
[5:27:35] <r_r_8_8_> She moves too predictably
[5:27:35] <crashercraft3434> wtf is this title, is this true? hahaha
[5:27:39] <TrueWm> @friendlyrichard i agrre
[5:27:42] <Kryffin> how/why was he able to one shot somebody? (execution while on the ground)
[5:27:42] <dvdmu> hmm kill david or get the chilistack?
[5:27:43] <TrueWm> agree*
[5:27:52] <otzs_manservant> @friendlyrichard a lot of people had ideas how to nerf her
[5:28:04] <otzs_manservant> I liked that she can't blink multiple times
[5:28:07] <BearackObama> WutFace
[5:28:10] <otzs_manservant> if she missed a blink
[5:28:12] <soulharveste> @Otzdarva can you also play ghostface after this ? Cheer100

[5:28:26] <Dorkzillaa> @MadMavericc she doesnt need to be nerfed, other killers need to be buffed so survivor-only mains have something else to complain about besides nurse Kappa
[5:28:27] <marcelluscoxa> Wait
[5:28:27] <cauchemarel> Can we get Leatherface teleporting around the map? Seems like a decent enough buff otzHarry

[5:28:37] <Malue> Mori kills make me happy
[5:28:40] <Zay_The_Pharaoh> Did you get that legion build together?
[5:28:41] <gorgonzola95> @Dorkzillaa they have Spirit
[5:28:43] <visnja_pevec> @Otzdarva which one of these killers is more viable: myers or bubba with pwyf?
[5:28:43] <r_r_8_8_> Devour hope I believe
[5:28:43] <xmstrikeout> @ mpds can I ask my question again if it didn't get recognised at the first time?
[5:28:44] <ShapedWhisper> The biggest hurdle to learning nurse is to have the patience to not blink
[5:28:50] <wicked1one> Leatherface can pogo stick bounce on his chainsaw
[5:28:51] <Dorkzillaa> @gorgonzola95 the more the merrier
[5:28:51] <Floofyboy> wow no pip for this lol
[5:29:02] <kittycatjustu> @otzdarva Do you have any tips for playing against red ranks? I’ve only been playing for a month got to purple for both roles and I kind of get bodied, wouldn’t be a problem if it wasn’t to the point where I don’t learn anything, with that said I don’t have many perks still but, I don’t think it’s like that huge, right?
[5:29:03] <King_Jasen> @cauchemarel well no other killer can compete with her mobility and have a good power

[5:32:40] <dr4g0vt> where is the ghost face of that man
[5:32:43] <ShapedWhisper> @Otzdarva Do you think the the odds of finding the key in jigsaw boxes are a coinflip or do you think there is a pre-determined key in each? I learned from another player's study it was a coinflip and it kind of feels like that even if you add in as many boxes as possible on the map.
[5:32:44] <whereispoor> You were supposed to play GF, Otz
[5:32:47] <kixshadowlaw> @Otzdarva Hello Otz! Awesome to see you again! Is it worth prestiging killers/survivors?

[5:33:19] <lichy_popo> 90s time
[5:33:20] <NocturnalPie> What do you mean awful build D:
[5:33:20] <Loaderiser> M&A is really good in general. Also allows every Killer to use Nurse's Calling effectively
[5:33:25] <cboybilly> Nooo why

[5:33:28] <PastimeRemembrance> Trapper after at last game of the night, please?

[5:34:06] <wicked1one> Promise them smooches
[5:34:09] <mro123321> @Otzdarva If your Legion build disincentives healing with ThanaButcher, wouldn't Monitor be good to capitalize on unaware injured survivors?
[5:34:13] <kixshadowlaw> @Otzdarva Hello Otz! Awesome to see you again! Is it worth prestiging killers/survivors???
[5:34:15] <RayMan1020> @ShapedWhisper Which is why the very last one is the right one. IF it was a coinflip for each it would have a chance of never getting it off
[5:34:18] <cauchemarel> @WolfTheSkeleton by being an absolute unit of a person, probs
[5:34:32] <teemoauu> What killer should i learn and play to rank UP and first thing to have fun with?
[5:34:36] <kixshadowlaw> @Otzdarva Hello Otz! Awesome to see you again! Is it worth prestiging killers/survivors??

[5:34:48] <ShapedWhisper> @RayMan1020 I've heard there may be a built in mechanic to ensure the last box always has the key though
[5:34:48] <TrueWm> before you end your stream you should read the first 6 pages on your stream comments

[5:35:27] <RayMan1020> @ShapedWhisper But why use 2 mechanics (Coinflip and last one has it) if one is sufficient for both

[5:36:04] <ScoutWalker> peepoSad peepoPet peepoHappy
[5:36:11] <L0st_And_Damn3d> @otzs_manservant mods cant ban me Kappa
[5:36:15] <PastimeRemembrance> he should read those at the beginning of his stream so he can brutally kill survivors to get all his rage out @TrueWm
[5:36:19] <ScoutWalker> debatable
[5:36:35] <otzs_manservant> @L0st_And_Damn3d holy shit otzDARVA
[5:36:36] <TrueWm> @PastimeRemembrance i have one on there that i want him to read, i find it very funny
[5:36:50] <ShapedWhisper> @RayMan1020 Because the coding in this game may be weird, I'm not sure I'm trying to figure out the RNG and might do my own tests
[5:36:54] <r_r_8_8_> soy down
[5:36:57] <H4velTheRock> those head on plays
[5:37:00] <H4velTheRock> monkaS
[5:37:03] <frostneir_games> honestly otz isnt toxic or blame bad gameplay on anything undeserving. basically speaking tis he gives credit where credit is due in a positive way so i feel thats poart of his luck with getting non toxic players for the most part
[5:37:06] <lichy_popo> lol that shirt
[5:37:23] <PastimeRemembrance> @TrueWm okay that works then otzBrain
[5:37:31] <tomash58> @tomash58 is new here. Say hello! HeyGuys
[5:37:46] <ScoutWalker> @tomash58 howdy geefHi
[5:37:50] <TrueWm> *at this moment jake realized, he fucked up*
[5:37:50] <numbscar> nicee
[5:37:53] <hadezord7> this is fucking amazing
[5:37:54] <numbscar> ralphGasm
[5:37:58] <zmaestoso> Is ghostface just a better myers? EW3 "on demand"
[5:37:59] <lichy_popo> hi!
[5:38:00] <soulharveste> @Otzdarva do you think ghostface is a top 5 killer ? Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1
[5:38:03] <RayMan1020> @ShapedWhisper Alright well good luck
[5:38:06] <Zay_The_Pharaoh> Chaining downs feels good
[5:38:09] <r_r_8_8_> So this is the power of Ghost Face, huh?
[5:38:13] <wicked1one> Can survivors see how far along the stalk meter is?
[5:38:14] <r_r_8_8_> Not bad
[5:38:27] <ScoutWalker> nope wicked
[5:38:33] <WolfTheSkeleton> otz do you knwo demiplays?
[5:38:34] <ScoutWalker> not until they are exposed
[5:38:37] <lichy_popo> only 1 way 2 find ut
[5:38:42] <wicked1one> riporronni
[5:38:48] <otzs_manservant> @zmaestoso Michael has it on demand; so does GF; Michael needs to stalk 1 time and down as much as he wants, GF needs to stalk each person; Michael can kill people and not lose the 99% stalk, GF can't touch stalked survivors or he loses it
[5:38:57] <otzs_manservant> also T3 Myers gets faster vault
[5:39:04] <otzs_manservant> and bigger lunge
[5:39:04] <loius_joe> 99.9%
[5:39:05] <r_r_8_8_> Pro plays
[5:39:09] <otzs_manservant> and more fangirls
[5:39:11] <otzs_manservant> Kappa
[5:39:18] <otzs_manservant> but he is limited per survivor
[5:39:20] <otzs_manservant> GF isn't
[5:39:24] <lichy_popo> PFFF
[5:39:30] <otzs_manservant> also Myers can't crouch, GF can
[5:40:00] <otzs_manservant> and Myers starts off in a disdvantage against good survivors (T1 is a liability against people who know how to not look at the gen when you're working on it)
[5:40:01] <sugawolf85> Myers can moonwalk
[5:40:07] <zmaestoso> So Myers < Ghostface < Shirtless Myers
[5:40:10] <otzs_manservant> GF doesn't
[5:40:13] <LonePhantom_69> Damm I read 'GF' as girlfirend
[5:40:24] <otzs_manservant> wait aren't we talking about girlfriends?
[5:40:26] <otzs_manservant> Keepo
[5:40:43] <grimreaper9346> @otzs_manservant when you said GF i thought you meant girlfriend LUL
[5:40:43] <RayMan1020> @LonePhantom_69 LUL so did i for a long time
[5:40:44] <TrueWm> whats a "girlfriend"

[5:40:53] <zmaestoso> You may have a DECISIVE advantage, but they have a DECISIVE strike Kappa
[5:40:56] <L0st_And_Damn3d> GF DansGame
[5:41:02] <sugawolf85> Guardian Force
[5:41:08] <otzs_manservant> a DECISIVE pummeling!
[5:41:11] <nilskeller04> This jake fought well for his life , too bad he still died
[5:41:13] <r_r_8_8_> >tfw no GF
[5:41:15] <otzs_manservant> props to anyone who gets the quote
[5:41:18] <ShapedWhisper> I feel like GhostFace's meme build should be the opposite of Burger King Myer's and that's to go as fast as possible while crouching
[5:41:19] <wicked1one> For only $8, you too can get gf
[5:41:19] <gorgonzola95> The only way they can win now is DC

[5:44:06] <r_r_8_8_> @gorgonzola95 Cool, I was having some trouble with Bubba because of the tight angles. Or maybe that's the Freddy map, can't be sure.

[5:47:00] <Succer> FeelsBadMan
[5:47:07] <kilroy2400> !ghostface
[5:47:07] <Nightbot> The Ghost Face can hide his presence and stalk each survivor to potentially one-shot them, as long as he's not seen. When not in stealth mode, he has an average movement speed (115%) and terror radius (32m).
[5:47:13] <M3lonade> @kixshadowlaw only if you care about the cosmetics man apart from that nah
[5:47:13] <kixshadowlaw> @Otzdarva Hello Otz! Awesome to see you again! Is it worth prestiging killers/survivors?
