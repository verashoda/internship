Winners get their bet back and split 2x the losers' bets, divided based on how much they personally bet. You can type !lettuce in chat to have Streamlabs whisper your Lettuce to you! krippCash

I was jealous of how smart you are and how much Becca enjoyed spending time with you. I spent a lot of time after high school reflecting on my behavior, and I eventually became a better person. Lucky for me, Becca still wanted to be in my life, and now we're raising two beautiful children together. I'm glad to see you're doing so well for yourself, too. Becca says hi, by the way!

To bet, just type !bet (low, mid, high) (1 - 100), for example !bet mid 50 wagers 50 Lettuce on 6 - 8 wins. Winners get their bet back and split 2x the losers' bets, divided based on how much they personally bet. You can type !lettuce in chat to have Streamlabs whisper your Lettuce to you! krippCash

Winners get their bet back and split 2x the losers' bets, divided based on how much they personally bet. You can type !lettuce in chat to have Streamlabs whisper your Lettuce to you! krippCash

To bet, just type !bet (low, mid, high) (1 - 100), for example !bet mid 50 wagers 50 Lettuce on 6 - 8 wins. Winners get their bet back and split 2x the losers' bets, divided based on how much they personally bet. You can type !lettuce in chat to have Streamlabs whisper your Lettuce to you! krippCash

[2:13:04] <Nightbot> krippCash You earn 1 Lettuce every 15 min just by watching! Then use that Lettuce to bet on Arena. To bet, just type !bet (low, mid, high) (1 - 100), for example !bet mid 50 wagers 50 Lettuce on 6 - 8 wins. Winners get their bet back and split 2x the losers' bets, divided based on how much they personally bet. You can type !lettuce in chat to have Streamlabs whisper your Lettuce to you! krippCash

[2:25:37] <Nightbot> krippCash You earn 1 Lettuce every 15 min just by watching! Then use that Lettuce to bet on Arena. To bet, just type !bet (low, mid, high) (1 - 100), for example !bet mid 50 wagers 50 Lettuce on 6 - 8 wins. Winners get their bet back and split 2x the losers' bets, divided based on how much they personally bet. You can type !lettuce in chat to have Streamlabs whisper your Lettuce to you! krippCash

[2:31:59] <Nightbot> krippCash You earn 1 Lettuce every 15 min just by watching! Then use that Lettuce to bet on Arena. To bet, just type !bet (low, mid, high) (1 - 100), for example !bet mid 50 wagers 50 Lettuce on 6 - 8 wins. Winners get their bet back and split 2x the losers' bets, divided based on how much they personally bet. You can type !lettuce in chat to have Streamlabs whisper your Lettuce to you! krippCash

You rave about the health benefits of becoming a leaf-muncher, but look at you! You're a pale, scrawny, hallowed-out husk of a man. Hell, you probably can't even lift up a hamburger with those pitiful arms of yours. If you don't stop hating on meat, I'm gonna come by in my truck and force-feed you my "giant sausage!"

[2:44:45] <Nightbot> krippCash You earn 1 Lettuce every 15 min just by watching! Then use that Lettuce to bet on Arena. To bet, just type !bet (low, mid, high) (1 - 100), for example !bet mid 50 wagers 50 Lettuce on 6 - 8 wins. Winners get their bet back and split 2x the losers' bets, divided based on how much they personally bet. You can type !lettuce in chat to have Streamlabs whisper your Lettuce to you! krippCash

[2:51:56] <rakpop> Hotform sees another invite to a friendly Fireside duel from Kripp and wants to move into fetal curl, but his hand is chained to the heater. Rania steps next to his laptop, putting dry bread and tap water down. ‚ÄúCome on, Hotform, it is only 3 more hours today. You can even have some lettuce for dinner.‚Äù His eyes tear up while he accepts the invite and mulligans his hand, but then he sees Kripp‚Äôs first card, it‚Äôs a lackey. ‚ÄúNo, nononono, please, please!

[3:11:36] <Nightbot> krippCash You earn 1 Lettuce every 15 min just by watching! Then use that Lettuce to bet on Arena. To bet, just type !bet (low, mid, high) (1 - 100), for example !bet mid 50 wagers 50 Lettuce on 6 - 8 wins. Winners get their bet back and split 2x the losers' bets, divided based on how much they personally bet. You can type !lettuce in chat to have Streamlabs whisper your Lettuce to you! krippCash

[3:18:20] <Kassire> Fortnite, as a game, shows the failures of capitalism. The whole premise of buying VBucks for bling and novelty with real money creates a divide between the rich and the poor over something completely useless. The struggle to compete for weapons in game shows how people who get lucky will win - if, under a communistic style - Fortnite started with everyone sharing the same weapons, only then will the best at the game win the royale.

[3:24:21] <adcritical1> @nl_kripp what do you think about reborn effects and arena?
[3:24:26] <TheSquash_> Hotform sees another invite to a friendly Fireside duel from Kripp and wants to move into fetal curl, but his hand is chained to the heater. Rania steps next to his laptop, putting dry bread and tap water down. ‚ÄúCome on, Hotform, it is only 3 more hours today. You can even have some lettuce for dinner.‚Äù His eyes tear up while he accepts the invite and mulligans his hand, but then he sees Kripp‚Äôs first card, it‚Äôs a lackey. ‚ÄúNo, nononono, please, please! Kill me! Just kill me! CHAT! CHAT HELP ME!

To bet, just type !bet (low, mid, high) (1 - 100), for example !bet mid 50 wagers 50 Lettuce on 6 - 8 wins. Winners get their bet back and split 2x the losers' bets, divided based on how much they personally bet. You can type !lettuce in chat to have Streamlabs whisper your Lettuce to you! krippCash

Considering the average 8 year old is 50.5 inches tall and the average adult woman is 63.7 inches tall, we can estimate that her height will increase by about 20.7% by adulthood, which would make her about 9.05 feet, 108.6 inches tall.

To bet, just type !bet (low, mid, high) (1 - 100), for example !bet mid 50 wagers 50 Lettuce on 6 - 8 wins. Winners get their bet back and split 2x the losers' bets, divided based on how much they personally bet. You can type !lettuce in chat to have Streamlabs whisper your Lettuce to you! krippCash

[4:08:55] <Nightbot> krippCash You earn 1 Lettuce every 15 min just by watching! Then use that Lettuce to bet on Arena. To bet, just type !bet (low, mid, high) (1 - 100), for example !bet mid 50 wagers 50 Lettuce on 6 - 8 wins. Winners get their bet back and split 2x the losers' bets, divided based on how much they personally bet. You can type !lettuce in chat to have Streamlabs whisper your Lettuce to you! krippCash

[4:15:54] <Nightbot> krippCash You earn 1 Lettuce every 15 min just by watching! Then use that Lettuce to bet on Arena. To bet, just type !bet (low, mid, high) (1 - 100), for example !bet mid 50 wagers 50 Lettuce on 6 - 8 wins. Winners get their bet back and split 2x the losers' bets, divided based on how much they personally bet. You can type !lettuce in chat to have Streamlabs whisper your Lettuce to you! krippCash

[4:19:01] <rakpop> Hotform sees another invite to a friendly Fireside duel from Kripp and wants to move into fetal curl, but his hand is chained to the heater. Rania steps next to his laptop, putting dry bread and tap water down. ‚ÄúCome on, Hotform, it is only 3 more hours today. You can even have some lettuce for dinner.‚Äù His eyes tear up while he accepts the invite and mulligans his hand, but then he sees Kripp‚Äôs first card, it‚Äôs a lackey. ‚ÄúNo, nononono, please, please! Kill me! Just kill me! CHAT! CHAT HELP ME!

[4:19:02] <doctor_mav> I sexually identify as Kripp. Since I was little, I always dreamed of shouting top deck Flamestrike! Seriously, how many board clears did this guy have, like 6? People tell me that being a vegan is fucking retarded but I don't care, I'm going second. I'm having a Mind Control Tech install shitty cards on my hand and remove board clears from my deck. If you don't respect my right to go sleep earlier when tilted you're a sniper and I'll have mellen ban you for racism.

To bet, just type !bet (low, mid, high) (1 - 100), for example !bet mid 50 wagers 50 Lettuce on 6 - 8 wins. Winners get their bet back and split 2x the losers' bets, divided based on how much they personally bet. You can type !lettuce in chat to have Streamlabs whisper your Lettuce to you! krippCash

[4:48:31] <matsplat99> @nl_Kripp Kripp seen any good movies lately?
[4:48:33] <giraffenoises> A few feet offscreen, Dex sits in a cage far too small for himself. Malnourished because of his "vegan" diet, his ribs are clearly visible through his coat. He barely has the energy to move, let alone enjoy life. Yet, he knows there's hope. He knows he could draw attention to himself, as he hears Kripp constantly talking to someone. In a single act of defiance, Dex barks to draw attention to his dire situation. "Quiet, Dex" is his only reply as Kripp ignores his pleas yet again.

To bet, just type !bet (low, mid, high) (1 - 100), for example !bet mid 50 wagers 50 Lettuce on 6 - 8 wins. Winners get their bet back and split 2x the losers' bets, divided based on how much they personally bet. You can type !lettuce in chat to have Streamlabs whisper your Lettuce to you! krippCash

[5:08:47] <blntaftrblnt> A few feet offscreen, Dex sits in a cage far too small for himself. Malnourished because of his "vegan" diet, his ribs are clearly visible through his coat. He barely has the energy to move, let alone enjoy life. Yet, he knows there's hope. He knows he could draw attention to himself, as he hears Kripp constantly talking to someone. In a single act of defiance, Dex barks to draw attention to his dire situation. "Quiet, Dex" is his only reply as Kripp ignores his pleas yet again.

[5:30:52] <iQPirate> A few feet offscreen, Dex sits in a cage far too small for himself. Malnourished because of his "vegan" diet, his ribs are clearly visible through his coat. He barely has the energy to move, let alone enjoy life. Yet, he knows there's hope. He knows he could draw attention to himself, as he hears Kripp constantly talking to someone. In a single act of defiance, Dex barks to draw attention to his dire situation. "Quiet, Dex" is his only reply as Kripp ignores his pleas yet again.

[5:58:50] <vaulthunter1708> A few feet offscreen, Dex sits in a cage far too small for himself. Malnourished because of his "vegan" diet, his ribs are clearly visible through his coat. He barely has the energy to move, let alone enjoy life. Yet, he knows there's hope. He knows he could draw attention to himself, as he hears Kripp constantly talking to someone. In a single act of defiance, Dex barks to draw attention to his dire situation. "Quiet, Dex" is his only reply as Kripp ignores his pleas yet again.

[6:17:28] <Nightbot> krippCash You earn 1 Lettuce every 15 min just by watching! Then use that Lettuce to bet on Arena. To bet, just type !bet (low, mid, high) (1 - 100), for example !bet mid 50 wagers 50 Lettuce on 6 - 8 wins. Winners get their bet back and split 2x the losers' bets, divided based on how much they personally bet. You can type !lettuce in chat to have Streamlabs whisper your Lettuce to you! krippCash

I‚Äôm a boy that‚Äôs why I was saying roleplay.. this isn‚Äôt a troll. again, I know it‚Äôs really random and weird. I‚Äôm sorry.

[6:30:42] <Nightbot> krippCash You earn 1 Lettuce every 15 min just by watching! Then use that Lettuce to bet on Arena. To bet, just type !bet (low, mid, high) (1 - 100), for example !bet mid 50 wagers 50 Lettuce on 6 - 8 wins. Winners get their bet back and split 2x the losers' bets, divided based on how much they personally bet. You can type !lettuce in chat to have Streamlabs whisper your Lettuce to you! krippCash

[6:35:44] <Nightbot> krippCash You earn 1 Lettuce every 15 min just by watching! Then use that Lettuce to bet on Arena. To bet, just type !bet (low, mid, high) (1 - 100), for example !bet mid 50 wagers 50 Lettuce on 6 - 8 wins. Winners get their bet back and split 2x the losers' bets, divided based on how much they personally bet. You can type !lettuce in chat to have Streamlabs whisper your Lettuce to you! krippCash
