[0:52:13] <Kenjosun> @TheHomoDwarf yes
[0:52:14] <SuperchargedQa> Change the matte
[0:52:18] <xDWizZz> @summit1g I think Boe has to back away a decent amount and you have to get in first.

[0:52:44] <Slyth7> @summit1g Have boe get out the car first, before you use the plate.
[0:52:45] <PaperSC2> make bo walk a little bit away when you apply the next plate @summit1g
[0:52:45] <NickUnknown> i think it scuffed cuz boe was on in the car when you started putting on the plate
[0:52:47] <3volv3d> @JustJamieHDG Curtis was 12, so yea q boss is mad today
[0:52:47] <dirreeN> Boe cant be in the car when you put it on

[1:13:25] <JFry99x> Ya vinny uses his car all the time with fake plates I feel like it’s bugged @summit1g
[1:13:26] <gasrygamer> You just need 2nd hostage
[1:13:27] <KareemMajeens> @Tacopassion NF
[1:13:27] <StavisSC> could threaten to shoot hostage if they touch your car to try to prevent them from checking on foot

[2:50:57] <WickedSickRL> That chase was fucking insane though
[2:50:57] <kickassandchewgum> tazer through the windscreen LUL
[2:50:57] <syphixtv> they already had it out for other things then came to jewelry, they didn't pull out it because they saw jewelry

[2:51:03] <chickennugget1997> They need to make it run out of fuel faster.
[2:51:03] <t0rns0ul> shoulda reversed instead
[2:51:04] <Retributtion> @summit1g should have shot the cops in the tunnel bro

[2:51:12] <EST_Trixxx> Gotta give it too vinny tho
[2:51:12] <gullaj> shouldve stopped in the tunnels where it splits into 2 and hope the cop picks the other tunnel @summit1g
[2:51:12] <Anjelo_CrystaL> THAT WAS SO FACKING DOPE
[2:51:13] <DavidRushing1> I thought. eugene might have
[2:51:13] <BlueEyedParadox> They shouldn't be allowed to taze you when you're already inside the car :/
[2:51:13] <Rainfaller> yep, like i said reverse
[2:51:14] <EvrMor> @summit1g heli was out for the biker shooting and u robbed after
[2:51:14] <Vraxes_Gaming> and a cop on your six telling the chopper where you were going
[2:51:14] <ItsTropiKsss> Eugene hooked u up tho!
[2:51:14] <YoloSmokinDoloSolo> @summit1g it wasnt his body lol u just hit the car as u can see
[2:51:14] <ItzBryanBro> @m0no nope. You get sprayed down by an AR from above and you need to stfu until medical arrives
[2:51:14] <spedtronicss> heli encourages shootouts its so stupid
[2:51:15] <punajuustokeke> LOL
[2:51:15] <WherezDAX> They can use a helicopter but get mad when you use a fast car

[2:51:23] <smacklikedatgaming> great chase none the less @summit1g
[2:51:24] <bentlee412> It didnt start shooting until a cop was shot at or killed
[2:51:25] <Hippypooo> it was pretty simple, when you was in the tunnels and had distance on the car should have swung a 180 and went back the way you came
[2:51:26] <H3LPS1DE> Bruh literally just listening to the cops on the other end that heli is INSANE every road every turn every car color lol they see everything
[2:51:27] <InsomniaCrazy> imagine eugene comes to steal a cop car l0l
[2:51:27] <notdone2> I think only Vinny shot while you were cuffed so should be good
[2:51:27] <Sabbaer666> shooting from the heli should not be a point......... that is op

[2:52:04] <thekhangreen> That crown vic would be undrivable IRL that cop should not have kept chasing you
[2:52:04] <disflux> They would have no idea that the other guy was guilty at the time the helicopter shot. Use that in court.
[2:52:04] <iB_TeRroR> The fact he said wanna trade cars made me loose it
[2:52:04] <Crazybro> Summit didnt shoot

[3:04:00] <Kamacizy> yeah, how could you possibly even lose a helicopter if all tunnels lead to one exit? seems a bit op, honestly
[3:04:00] <Tell_CS> Then they shot you from the copter
[3:04:02] <WickedSickRL> There were a couple scuffed parts there. Just bad luck tbh. It was a sick chase either way.

[3:51:15] <jeditricks_> 450 months
[3:51:16] <dvsgr1m> good rp should reduce time
[3:51:18] <timblenaut> there has to be some reason to avoid shooting all the time, decently long sentences are a control on online-chaos
[3:51:19] <Quince47> LUL

[3:51:54] <AnthonyHomie69> Ohh when they were thinking of pushing First Degree Murder
[3:51:54] <aladys22> dang just tuned in, how did we get in jail? lol
[3:51:58] <laszily> they should just make the chores do a percent of your crime down, so if you have a huge sentence, you can get it down faster
[3:51:58] <ozzi2702> there was a point when you was gone there was alot of police shootouts with lean bois and speedy
[3:51:59] <mortiiboii> he did a bench trial
[3:52:00] <luldooku> was waiting for trial and only ended up with 30 months
[3:52:00] <cfh_hitman> fukin OMEGA

[3:52:14] <metalmulisha___> he got alot off
[3:52:16] <StopCache> F
[3:52:17] <greenwoodguy> he wanted the bench trial, that was his choice
[3:52:20] <kappadonna123> Imagine having to serve a long sentence LOLE moon2Y
[3:52:22] <Kebobs22> Thats why a lot of people who get major sentences a lot make second characters
[3:52:23] <Theinfamousqueef> how much time did he get?
[3:52:23] <donethedon> Man if Chang gang doesn’t break you out that’s bs
