[0:23:29] <thekrautinator> well remember I got tboned on my motorcycle on the night of the 4th of July.. well I shattered my right legs on a few places and also broke a few other bones... long story short they had to put rods and pins in my leg and then here about a week ago I developed what they call "compartment syndrome" which sucks ass
[0:23:54] <thekrautinator> leg*
[0:25:38] <thekrautinator> compartment syndrome is essentially my body is rejecting my metal in my leg which caused a shit load of swelling and I was getting sick... it's the same instance as what your body does when you get a sliver and it try to push it out and heal itself...

[3:34:19] <the_hermenator> @grog_xx I have like 30 wins already and got octane
[3:34:24] <jcurlee> @knock_knock_next that 1440p 165hz is holding you back you can get way better frames with 240hz and 1080p
[3:34:45] <the_hermenator> Cheezit
[3:34:52] <wcjammin> Is there a character meta for this game

[3:35:00] <knock_knock_next> Yeah I run 2560x1440pm
[3:35:56] <knock_knock_next> Guess I’m trying to figure out the diff from 1080 to 2560 if it’s only 20frames then really ima stick with 2560
[3:36:32] <knock_knock_next> I know all the pros use 1080
[3:36:53] <jcurlee> @knock_knock_next yea if you ask any pro what they play on its gonna always be 24" 1080p its way more consistent frame rates

[4:25:01] <bluey3947> mad games adn you got a dog! ken oath! might of found a new streamer
[4:25:14] <FreedomFPS> So it looks like xgames format is 1 point per kill, and 20 for a win. Teams that play too conservative will likely end up lagging in points.
[4:25:25] <tehsealgo> Bye jorDAN, love ya <3

[4:27:07] <bluey3947> blue heeler, border collies are smart as fuck awesome dogs
[4:27:11] <FreedomFPS> Weird. ESL rules list 1 point for kill and 20 for win.
[4:27:17] <0MGVVTFBBQ> So excited to watch xgames, team rogue all the way!
[4:27:39] <trance90> I love that Watson and caustic are the meta now
[4:27:43] <PhantomzoneTV> @HusKerrs It's pronounced dock-sund. LUL It's the wiener dog.
[4:28:10] <FreedomFPS> Lower points for win and placement make it even more worth to play pretty aggro mid game.
[4:28:12] <jcurlee> LUL
[4:28:36] <mikygbro> nutty
[4:28:57] <0MGVVTFBBQ> effin headshot without a scope
[4:29:00] <therealflopalapagous> well

[4:30:08] <zil_> should i unfollow to refollow?
[4:30:10] <0MGVVTFBBQ> except when they sub LUL
[4:30:11] <darksandwolf_> It's 10 for the win right?

[4:31:25] <FreedomFPS> You're right, I found a copy of qualifier rules.
[4:31:27] <FreedomFPS> https://liquipedia.net/apexlegends/EXP/Invitational/Apex_Legends_at_X_Games_Minneapolis
[4:31:44] <Scuffed> where’s ston3r
[4:32:21] <FreedomFPS> 1st place - 12 Points. 2nd place - 9 Points. 3rd place - 7 Points. 4th place - 5 Points. 5th place - 4 Points. 6th - 10th place - 2 Points. 11th - 15th place - 1 Points. 16th - 20th place - 0 Points.
[4:32:22] <piecemealspark4> Yeah for the qualifiers I read that it’s 1 point per kill and 20 for the win. Could be different for the real deal
[4:34:18] <FreedomFPS> 12 matches total. Doesn't say if you pick your matches like qual or if you use all 12.
[4:34:50] <Novaskii> Na tripple take has good hip fire

[4:39:02] <magicia9> *hack
[4:39:22] <0MGVVTFBBQ> LUL
[4:39:39] <FreedomFPS> Loot filters up. One team only has a certain chance to get good stuff, but if you wipe a couple squads, there's a pretty good chance you'll accumulate good loot.

[5:23:01] <thekidcub> @thekrautinator oh i’m with you there. sometimes coors light, bud light, etc. are the only option so i was curious to hear his input. what style of beer is your favorite?
[5:23:40] <FreedomFPS> I'm lucky to live in an area where even small bars generally have a local or craft on tap.
[5:24:08] <ThickN1ck> Why don’t you utilize your Caustic abilities more
[5:24:23] <stormdragon555> @huskerrs you know you can just right click attachments to swap them
[5:24:30] <SpearHeadFox> @thekidcub Yuengling is a good domestic beer
[5:24:34] <XxMON3YMOBxX> it was a shield in there
[5:24:53] <BibaStorm> Yo husk! My new PC is fully built but my keyboard won’t be here until tomorrow, so I’m using my phone for chat but watching from my PC. XD
[5:24:59] <thekrautinator> @thekidcub I like more of a wheat ale... some porters... just depends more of a mood thing for me and I was also born in Germany so beer there is much different then the states but if I'm getting down on some domestics I dont mind Budweiser... but will always go for a good ale or ipa
[5:24:59] <thekidcub> @spearheadfox i’m from PA! so that’s everywhere around here lol
[5:25:11] <FreedomFPS> I would do terrible things to be able to get Yuengling in Texas
[5:25:35] <jpetti6512> purple in that bag

[5:27:54] <thekrautinator> @thekidcub forsure San Diego has an amazing beer scene and brewers and germany just has alot more dark beers and more of a wholesome beer as far as buying a beer and enjoying it and it being a much higher alchohol content then some of the more spendy beers in the states
[5:28:16] <thekidcub> @boostlee29 i’ve heard that! will have to check out seattle at some time

[5:35:32] <thekrautinator> @thekidcub for sure man I live in the states now but I always go back
[5:35:41] <obsidiux_> Is this code for hookers
[5:35:44] <thekidcub> @dymagiba depends on your play style my man
[5:35:58] <thekrautinator> @thekidcub moved a few years ago
[5:36:19] <thekidcub> @thekrautinator you in the states now?
[5:36:40] <thekrautinator> @thekidcub yeah have been for a few years now
[5:36:49] <dymagiba> I usually run a wingman and any close range gun @thekidcub
[5:36:50] <Strategium7> doggo
[5:36:56] <Strategium7> FrankerZ
[5:37:04] <Seary> someone clip it Kappa
[5:37:30] <thekidcub> @dymagiba can’t go wrong with the wingman, huskers would probably suggest r99 for close range bc that’s his favorite overall gun
[5:37:39] <thecasual_1> LUL
[5:37:46] <thekidcub> @thekrautinator where at may i ask?
[5:37:55] <dymagiba> Even compared to the alternator? @thekidcub
[5:38:00] <full_send_it> husky pog
[5:38:12] <thekrautinator> @thekidcub in good ol idaho.. you?
[5:38:43] <DrPhilYourGap> Hey dad
[5:38:49] <jmill25> Not playing watson anymore?
[5:39:06] <Taigarrrrr> You keep checking what's underneath your shirt
[5:39:09] <DrPhilYourGap> hahahah
[5:39:17] <kaylagray6> Why do you keep looking underneath your shirt
[5:39:19] <thekidcub> @dymagiba the way i think of it is the wingman and alternator w/ disruptor rounds are both great for breaking shields, but once shields are broken the r99 would have a quicker ttk
[5:39:25] <thecasual_1> lmfao
[5:39:31] <itburnswhenipeepee> Hey huskerss
[5:39:42] <lifon_kb> checkin on them abs

[5:40:23] <Markman277> that hit rete tho shroud?
[5:40:24] <thekidcub> @dymagiba than the alternator once shields are broken
[5:40:56] <Bahsurq> you guys have a team house?
[5:41:11] <dymagiba> Ohh okay okay, makes sense. Thank you @thekidcub
[5:41:19] <magicia9> scrims loot will be customised by the admin?
[5:41:53] <JTVoyager> mods ?
[5:42:10] <thekidcub> @dymagiba do whatever feels comfortable for you, also depends whether you’re on pc or console. for example huskerrs is able to beam with the r99 from decent range but his aim is also top tier
[5:42:17] <thekrautinator> what did that even say lol?

[6:20:18] <Pacerr_> so more pros are starting to use caustic over wattson?
[6:20:42] <ThePB123> Diego is very good
[6:20:51] <brandon92x> What is xgames
[6:21:00] <ThePB123> could compete if he practiced with a squad

[6:21:19] <drunkenchicken> someone came in here and said he cheated lol
[6:21:21] <geesh> oooooooof
[6:21:21] <griffinsjr> shroud will be there??
[6:21:23] <donoi2000> diego is not a pro?
[6:21:26] <Taigarrrrr> Yeah i watched his gameplay, waaaaaay far from yours.
[6:21:27] <PaltryGazelle13> i think he is forsure
[6:21:35] <senzubeam666> Top 3 legends for comp?
[6:21:42] <sinzyee> do u think 144hz is a worth upgrade over 60hz if thinking about apex only?
[6:21:45] <thecattrick> he isn't pro
[6:21:50] <altair827> shroud no...
[6:21:53] <FreedomFPS> 144hz is so worth it.
[6:21:55] <daandinh> yes 144hz is a big up
[6:22:03] <chy33t> Diego has good aim but no positioning or teamwork
[6:22:09] <daandinh> 60hz will look like crap after
[6:22:11] <daandinh> lol
[6:22:20] <sinzyee> probably much easier to track on 144hz lol
[6:22:22] <ThePB123> !sense
[6:22:26] <ElCapoEU> diego clickbait vids is cringy af
[6:22:38] <ZigZaag> Thoughts on a controller player attending xgames? Think he even stands a chance
[6:22:48] <FreedomFPS> Even just regular computer usage at 60hz feels bad after enough time using a 144hz screen
[6:23:00] <daandinh> nicewigg is insane with a controller lol
[6:23:10] <sinzyee> 144hz is easier on the eyes too am i rite=
[6:23:21] <senzubeam666> Diego is definitely close to as good if not as good or better than pros. He just chooses to create content instead of grind comp
[6:23:21] <FreedomFPS> 144hz is popular with the ladies

[6:23:28] <chy33t> Wigg is good but clg doesnt have a chance
[6:23:52] <daandinh> probs
[6:24:10] <donoi2000> so who's the tournament favorite?
[6:24:28] <drunkenchicken> nrg or sen imo
[6:24:39] <PaltryGazelle13> @donoi2000 im predicting nrg or sen
[6:24:47] <jonimotaXD> tsm
[6:24:50] <altair827> shroud should play there... may be....
[6:24:54] <drunkenchicken> tsm is good too
[6:24:56] <lifon_kb> lol husk shat on sen
[6:24:57] <coolmintt> 144hz all depends on what you can even get frame rate wise no point in getting 144hz monitor if your computer only runs around 60 on apex
[6:25:16] <altair827> aceu looks good... nrg have a chance
[6:25:20] <xcaketownx> imagine thinking shroud is prolevel
[6:25:20] <daandinh> also true ^
[6:25:27] <drunkenchicken> aceu might be the best player
[6:25:36] <daandinh> need 144fps for 144hz
[6:25:45] <senzubeam666> Diego better than RogueDropped
[6:25:45] <drunkenchicken> but its still a team game
[6:25:46] <PaltryGazelle13> @drunkenchicken hes a monster
[6:25:49] <griffinsjr> sen is a bunch of beasts!!
[6:26:03] <daandinh> aceu's movement is amazing
[6:26:05] <drunkenchicken> yeah hes ridiculous

[7:36:35] <olddirteh> sing us a song good sir so that me test it for thee!
[7:36:37] <ShreyV7> @phantom_757_ mostly a wraith or a pathfinder is the one to initiate a rush

[7:37:23] <iampaddox> @ShreyV7 doesn't really matter who initiates
[7:37:28] <Phantom_757_> @shreyv7 I understand. But they must have it down to where one player is usually the one to do that
[7:37:50] <VIP_BossAlvin> Show stats bro plz

[7:38:05] <Xayxun> Wait it is? The premium one?

[7:38:11] <zfromthespace> is the xgame tourney a LAN
[7:38:13] <ShreyV7> @phantom_757_ yes so i think the one who plays wraith goes in usually if its a teamfight which all 3 decide
[7:38:19] <Taigarrrrr> Fried Noodles
