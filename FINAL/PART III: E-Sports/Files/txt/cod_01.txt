[1:21:31] <StreamElements> @chrisaudioeng, onecheesymofo has been streaming for 1 hour 21 mins
[1:21:56] <GAMINGFORSHOW> Yo, Speros talking shit about you earlier man, how he would not take a break. Is he toxic?
[1:21:56] <kick_as_assassin> Your sub music makes me want to play Zelda
[1:22:13] <kick_as_assassin> @gamingforshow Chill bro
[1:22:18] <iMrBlueSky> that doesn't sound true
[1:22:22] <westsidesnooker> Florida's best Killa
[1:22:24] <dondonblrrrp> Chill
[1:22:34] <jwolfson31> What do you mean? Are you sure you didn‚Äôt take it out of context? @gamingforshow
[1:22:35] <gkg_nardo> Don‚Äôt be toxic. Don‚Äôt start shit
[1:22:42] <josue_g93> @gamingforshow was he really?
[1:22:42] <tashino> surely not
[1:22:44] <kick_as_assassin> A mod needs to delete that comment
[1:22:45] <digital__ash> it kinda sounds like an ocarina
[1:22:50] <martysandel19> Don‚Äôt believe it
[1:22:58] <kimballwinsagain> come on Nacho! get the W!
[1:23:05] <OMG_itzDat1Guy> where the kids at???
[1:23:15] <OMG_itzDat1Guy> *mods
[1:23:21] <ClTlZEN> Speros never talks shit so why you lying?
[1:23:27] <sgiacomo84> speros is not like that....if he made a comment about "not taking a break" or something then that's just his personal opinion for himself and he always states that
[1:23:32] <GAMINGFORSHOW> he was live this morning. He just woke up. He said people losing their shit cos nacho not been online. And he said that he would not take a break
[1:23:32] <tashino> nice nade
[1:23:32] <razorhawg87> Kobe! lol
[1:23:48] <digital__ash> that doesnt sound like talking shit
[1:23:51] <tombom5767> That's where it's from
[1:23:54] <heyimjose21> @GAMINGFORSHOW thats not talking shit, stop trying to start shit
[1:24:01] <GAMINGFORSHOW> started back tracking
[1:24:13] <martysandel19> Bruh you needa chill quit trying to start shit

[1:24:39] <tashino> nacho shit
[1:24:40] <heyimjose21> i was in that stream, he didnt mean it to be a dick, he simply said that he doesnt take breaks, and nacho does, to each their own
[1:24:41] <gageshots> I was 100% in Speros stream and that's not what he said at all. He said let Nacho live his life and do what he wants. Then later said he doesn't take breaks. Not at all related.

[3:50:03] <cypriotone> No hair cut yet
[3:50:08] <jwolfson31> Better yet, a black ops 1 remaster with no micro transactions, no pay to play maps, etc & I‚Äôd buy in a heartbeat
[3:50:10] <callmesullivan> only hated it because it wasn't mw or bo
[3:50:11] <Backsmash_er> @carlos_silva1906 IW is big fail on COD!
[3:50:14] <mr_blu3_> the maps were crazy big
[3:50:19] <YankeeSkidKid6177> I loved the single player campaign for ghost but the multiplayer for ghost was trash
[3:50:27] <OMG_itzDat1Guy> COD Ghost was a great game
[3:50:35] <db255> Ghost was great imo.... Michael Myers field order
[3:50:38] <mr_blu3_> never really learned them
[3:50:39] <xWildflowerz> you'll know when he gets a haircut, because itll be his stream title
