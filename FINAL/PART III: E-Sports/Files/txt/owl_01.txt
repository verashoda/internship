[0:43:31] <Flygrumbz> @sizablemattress this man has helped all tank players pog
[0:43:43] <Nucklechutz> @Emongg real talk though, if you want to leave autofocus on, lower the frequency of the light shifting on your leds in the background, or move more than they do
[0:43:45] <Jahuki> tanky thanky lol

[1:11:34] <Nucklechutz> Hanzo has the hardest highlight bias for like, a year running now
[1:11:52] <Nucklechutz> he has new character highlight bias
[1:11:54] <SizableMattress> If my teammates pick three deeps and I'm solo tank I always tell 'em I don't mind. If they're more comfortable on deeps then they'll probably contribute better that way. We ain't GM or anything
[1:12:12] <wankinproductions> Your Orissa would let them pull two or three times before she would pull

[1:19:54] <AnarkiPlays> How about Vance instead of Gerald? Phyllis and Vance from The Office
[1:19:56] <SizableMattress> I think 2 Geralds are needed
[1:20:05] <AnarkiPlays> Bob Vance I meant

[1:20:39] <TIGERu> you like stubbed his toe with the hook
[1:20:41] <Nucklechutz> quick play -sr
[1:20:51] <SizableMattress> Be careful because the 6 dps comp is really good at putting out 2 seconds of solid deeps
[1:21:05] <TIGERu> Mei is a fun and engaging hero to play against OkayChamp
[1:21:17] <Nucklechutz> 6 dps = 6 hard carries, bro
[1:21:17] <snazzytc> 256 hero damage in a third of the round LUL
[1:21:19] <Doritos_R6> 6 DPS really is the play kgtvSbrain
[1:21:26] <wankinproductions> @emongg see look st the creativity we will never get games like this with 2-2-2 sad kappa
[1:21:39] <SizableMattress> And if everyone carries, you win

[1:24:30] <Doritos_R6> @TIGERu if the conversion is right your scope sense should be the same on both games
[1:24:32] <Nucklechutz> I have to run around my room to get my character to do a 180

[1:26:28] <hakktheplanet> I had a 6 dps team once and got 5 golds with Soldier LUL
[1:26:40] <TIGERu> I'm surprised the other team don't just play 4 snipers
[1:26:51] <netherbrixx> that dude switched to Soldier for the gold healing medal LUL

[1:29:03] <SizableMattress> Ah yes, S7 stands for season 4

[1:30:19] <Nucklechutz> 70% silica
[1:30:20] <Hidd3nFPS> @Emongg cam keeps making you blurry :(
[1:30:35] <KingKoroDullin> taco bell used to have a breakfast taco with a waffle for the tortilla
[1:30:40] <Nucklechutz> but the 30% that's beef is ALL beef
[1:30:50] <netherbrixx> worse LUL
[1:30:51] <KingKoroDullin> back in the early 2000s
[1:30:53] <Hidd3nFPS> i think the lights are making it focus on the rgb
[1:30:55] <capsNskins> breakfast tacos are everywhere in austin
[1:30:56] <ookamigin> waffle taco sounds yummy
[1:31:05] <LocalAreaMan_> Yeah you're still blurry
[1:31:05] <SizableMattress> That's a lotta beef
[1:31:15] <TIGERu> we have gotten into the habit of doordashing ihop on the weekends and I can recommend it emongEats
[1:31:16] <Nucklechutz> it is, he just needs to lower the freq. of the RGB color changer
[1:31:18] <netherbrixx> Emongg is streaming on a 320x240 camera from 1999
[1:31:28] <Nucklechutz> autofocuses care more about movement than proximity

[1:33:14] <Hidd3nFPS> i think its just auto focusing on the selves is all
[1:33:17] <Nucklechutz> cuz he fills?
[1:33:23] <TIGERu> because phyllis is dependable
[1:33:23] <pegasuss_tv> @Pegasuss_tv in this gym billyReady
[1:33:26] <AnarkiPlays> Emongg uses Sony SLR cameras for webcam right? Should be a function in there to adjust the sensitivity for autofocus
[1:33:35] <Fissionmailedgf> Phylliss was taken so he had to use Phyllis
[1:33:37] <LocalAreaMan_> Yeah it's not as blurry now compared to what it was
[1:33:40] <Nucklechutz> it;s the frequency of the lights
[1:33:47] <Hidd3nFPS> sounds POG
[1:33:50] <Nucklechutz> the right edge of your bookcase is crisp af
[1:33:50] <Thekingofhotdogs> It's okay, all we want to see is the shelf anyway
[1:33:56] <ChaoticOCE> as long as the side camera works for fresh nuts its all good
[1:34:03] <Nucklechutz> pretend I went to film school and take my word for it
[1:34:09] <netherbrixx> maybe there's a ghost in the room and the camera is focusing on it monkaW

[1:34:24] <yoseph52> HI <3
[1:34:29] <legned2780> emongHands
[1:34:32] <SizableMattress> @Nucklechutz so if he wears the right color shirt, he'll show up less blurry
[1:34:39] <Hidd3nFPS> the shelves look dope af tho
[1:34:40] <Nucklechutz> no he has to move more
[1:34:44] <Nucklechutz> or the lights move less
[1:34:47] <bslancaster> @emongg I just got here but I must say, you look ready.

[1:34:59] <Flygrumbz> emongThicc emongLurk
[1:35:01] <Nucklechutz> autofocus usually focuses on what moved last
[1:35:03] <Thekingofhotdogs> @SizableMattress it's not focusing on the color, it's focusing on the constantly shifting colors
[1:35:08] <SizableMattress> So if the lights change color, he'll look less blurry
[1:35:18] <Nucklechutz> if they change color more slowly
[1:35:24] <Thekingofhotdogs> If the lights 'move' slower it will be better
[1:35:25] <Nucklechutz> or not at all would be best
[1:35:27] <netherbrixx> emongThicc 💨 emongLurk
[1:35:37] <spoob> Yah yEet
[1:35:39] <SizableMattress> Or if his shirt perpetually changes color, as shirts do, he'll look less blurry
[1:35:44] <Flygrumbz> Just make them all white Kappa
[1:35:51] <Nucklechutz> actually, best is no autofocus and have someone frame him in when he's sitting there
[1:36:03] <TIGERu> this is the multi talent baby PogU
[1:36:09] <Thekingofhotdogs> @Nucklechutz yeah but that sounds like work
[1:36:13] <Nucklechutz> he's already in texas, @Flygrumbz that's white enough
[1:36:47] <LocalAreaMan_> @Nucklechutz cmonBruh
[1:36:51] <SizableMattress> If he left Texas would he look less blurry?
[1:37:00] <Slaprock> monkaW
[1:37:06] <SizableMattress> It's blurry in Texas because it's so hot there
[1:37:07] <Flygrumbz> I’m white and live in Texas pepehands
[1:37:15] <Nucklechutz> @Thekingofhotdogs hence my suggestion to turn down the freq (which is probably a knob on power switch) of the lights. And yes, everything is more pixellated in Texas.
[1:37:21] <sugarbeet> LULW

[1:38:07] <deathburgerzcx> So you're going by "Emongg" now plebian? Haha what's up spurcifer, it's Tannerius from Rome. Remember me? Me and the other legionaries used to give a hard time. Sorry you were just an easy target. I can see not much has changed. Remember Seira, the girl you had a crush on? Yeah, she's my concubine now. I make over 200 sesterces a year and drive a quadriga chariot. I guess some things never change huh? Nice catching up. Patheticus.

[2:53:12] <replicantttv> Winston gets instantly melted now, the armor nerfs probably need to be reverted @fandumbb
[2:53:18] <Fandumbb> @tigeru it works great against the bunker if everyone dives point no one expect it I feel likes
[2:53:47] <Fandumbb> @replicantttv you usually want a DVA and Ball not a Winston unless they have a mercy and genji
[2:53:53] <TIGERu> @Fandumbb yeah that's what I try to do, if you go over/around the bunker they kinda have nowhere to go

[3:11:22] <Nucklechutz> pushing buttons to make the overwatch happen DOES take skill
[3:11:23] <idunn_a> {}
[3:11:24] <Sugared> hog is not aware :(
[3:11:51] <Nucklechutz> you gotta push em all real fast and then run back from spawn and do it again
[3:12:26] <TIGERu> it's like a quicktime event but the only button is Q
[3:12:28] <replicantttv> I hate Doom and he 100% takes skill. The fact that his kit is based around the ability to randomly one shot people doesn’t help my case though @h0lden13
[3:13:05] <Nucklechutz> I dunno, I don't go 20 and 5 in DM with any other character I'm sub 20 hours on
[3:13:10] <LoftyHunterStudios> save bongo
[3:13:22] <Nucklechutz> or 20 and 21, whatever
[3:13:29] <LoftyHunterStudios> awsum
[3:13:36] <replicantttv> Doom is a hard feed like 80% of the time he’s picked above platinum.
[3:13:36] <LilT0XiiC> Heyo!!
[3:13:47] <blankwav> yea doom takes some skill
[3:13:52] <Nucklechutz> hence Chipsa's cheery disposition
[3:14:03] <Nucklechutz> actually he may just be toxic
[3:14:16] <Hatsby> OkayChamp
[3:14:18] <LilT0XiiC> Good man how’s the games going tonight @emongg
[3:14:18] <blankwav> I respect doom players as much as they tilt me lul
[3:14:42] <h0lden13> if you can count his cooldowns i feel he is hard to deal with till like diamoind
[3:14:52] <Nucklechutz> doom is fun to play, and there is a higher skill tier of him, the kind that can focus-tilt a pharah
[3:14:55] <StreamElements> Emongg is now sponsored by iBuyPower, check them out here http://ibuypower.com/r/emongg Also, use code Emongg at checkout for 5% off!
[3:14:58] <replicantttv> He’s just not fun to play against at all, and that scales directly with the skill of the person using them and how bad your team is at managing him. Kinda like Widow.
[3:15:07] <cytrus_ow> !from
[3:15:08] <Nucklechutz> but you don't need to be THAT good at Doom apparently to reach 3500+
[3:15:29] <annunciationz> is that OWL Mistakes?
[3:15:40] <cytrus_ow> !from
[3:16:02] <replicantttv> We think so @annunciationz
[3:16:02] <Nucklechutz> console widow has always been the same, actually, Doom mains are rare enough to thin out the extremes of the curve
[3:16:02] <LilT0XiiC> I think Orissa is so boring to play. I’m an ex rein main though haha @emongg
[3:16:31] <h0lden13> i know like 3 people, yeah not many, but they all dropped main tank/or support and picked up doom and lcimbed 500 sr
[3:16:55] <Nucklechutz> know anyone who ever dropped dps and picked up main tank and climbed 500 sr?
[3:17:20] <TIGERu> orissa is a medal farmer if you're into that
[3:17:28] <TharTV> tbh is easier to climb as MT since no one plays it @Nucklechutz
[3:17:32] <replicantttv> That’s because dealing with Doom is inherently harder on ladder where people don’t communicate and bot out
[3:17:34] <LilT0XiiC> @nucklechutz Bro that’s fr me. I went from diamond to masters just switching to MT
[3:17:37] <h0lden13> lol no, bet someone did with orisa tho
[3:17:53] <annunciationz> of course doom is op in gold and plat
[3:17:56] <annunciationz> please can't aim
[3:17:59] <annunciationz> *people
[3:18:01] <Nucklechutz> so at a level where mechanical skill starts to normalize
[3:18:09] <Nucklechutz> main tank at plat below is molasses
[3:18:14] <replicantttv> Doom is an absolute mid tier terror the way Reaper and Bastion are in like gold and lower
[3:18:40] <LilT0XiiC> Very true @replicantttv

[3:19:43] <replicantttv> Emongg Rein is underrated
[3:19:56] <Nucklechutz> dark days, Emongg is main tanking, Dafran is flexing Ana/Orisa, and Water has to play hog
[3:19:58] <TharTV> when aer you gonna play your hammond acc again? @Emongg
[3:20:17] <Hatsby> dang that a lot o' hours O:
[3:20:17] <mtfuji> hog main WutFace
[3:20:19] <LilT0XiiC> Chat, which do you find more fun to play Orissa or rein
[3:20:20] <silver6ird> i'm one of 3 people that find orisa fun
[3:20:25] <Sniiskuu> thing is I subbed like 2 weeks ago and it just popped now
[3:20:30] <replicantttv> At least Ana utilizes Dafran’s mechanics LUL @nucklechutz
[3:20:39] <Jon625> @LilT0XiiC Neither
[3:20:45] <Nucklechutz> Orisa unless you're on attack on payload, at a point cap
[3:20:51] <LoftyHunterStudios> feelsbadman
[3:20:59] <trueheartgames> I like orisa. 4.3k, 20 hours played 63% win rate

[3:21:00] <Hatsby> FeelsBadMan
[3:21:01] <Nucklechutz> so does Orisa, actually
[3:21:03] <TIGERu> I'm happy to go orisa tbh
[3:21:05] <LoftyHunterStudios> yu'll get there
[3:21:16] <LoftyHunterStudios> orisa is boring
[3:21:22] <very6> any plats here stuck in orisa jail like me 🤪
[3:21:24] <Jon625> Main tanks are ZzZzZzZ af
[3:21:25] <LilT0XiiC> I agree lofty
[3:21:34] <Nucklechutz> sorry, I'm a scrub gold
[3:21:37] <very6> @jon625 agreed
[3:21:38] <Nucklechutz> not even pleb plat
[3:21:42] <mtfuji> @very6 I'm here for you
[3:21:42] <h0lden13> hot take that will get people upset bet, orisa needs major nerfs and so does widow
[3:21:56] <handsoappp> do you think orisa shield needs a nerf? if she does, do you think she'll be unplayable?
[3:21:58] <LilT0XiiC> @jon625 you’re probably dry non aggressive so you play the zzzzzz playstyle
[3:22:02] <very6> why does widow need nerf wtf?
[3:22:10] <TIGERu> they literally just nerfed orisa's shield
[3:22:12] <Ox0FF> emongg is gnome backwards - phyllis backwards is 'silly HP'
[3:22:13] <annunciationz> widow is fine
[3:22:15] <Jon625> @LilT0XiiC
[3:22:16] <very6> she’s fine where she is
[3:22:18] <annunciationz> they gotta nerf mei
[3:22:19] <very6> exactly
[3:22:24] <silver6ird> fareehaHONHON just don't get hit
[3:22:29] <Nucklechutz> she needs more counter play
[3:22:29] <very6> ^
[3:22:33] <replicantttv> Kinda, yeah. I meant more Ana having the carry potential inherent to Dafran’s usual DPS pool @nucklechutz
[3:22:36] <h0lden13> double sniper op, put her hook coold down backk to 12
[3:22:37] <fayeth> bliGLARE
[3:22:38] <mtfuji> make a headshot like 195
[3:22:42] <Jon625> @LilT0XiiC Rather heal then main tank tbh
[3:22:43] <Nucklechutz> gotcha
[3:22:47] <oceans_ttv> I had 2 shots of whiskey
[3:22:56] <oceans_ttv> Nowe im the benst widow ever
[3:22:59] <LoftyHunterStudios> lol
[3:23:02] <silver6ird> ricardoFlick
[3:23:10] <replicantttv> Balancing Widow is kinda hard.
[3:23:10] <Hatsby> good enemy sniper is always 'omg bs', tale as old as FPS
[3:23:12] <LilT0XiiC> @jon625 for sure man I totally get it. Thing ab MT is if your team doesn’t work with you you’re 8/10 times useless
[3:23:15] <TIGERu> 3 DPS OkayChamp
[3:23:26] <handsoappp> @TIGERu i wasnt aware, how is she nerfed?
[3:23:35] <Nucklechutz> they could feasibly revert the cooldown of her grapple
[3:23:36] <handsoappp> i mean how is the shield nerfed?
[3:23:41] <TIGERu> @handsoappp her shield has a longer cooldown now
[3:23:48] <peachwave> hA
[3:23:49] <TIGERu> it might not be in live yet though
[3:23:50] <very6> Emongg in orisa jail
[3:23:52] <mtfuji> 1 second longer shield cooldown
[3:23:55] <handsoappp> im assuming ptr?
[3:23:59] <handsoappp> oh i see, thanks!
[3:23:59] <h0lden13> no, the fact that widow is the only counter to widow is the issue. also incoming winston counters widows pleb
[3:24:14] <annunciationz> they should increase cd for mei wall

[3:24:29] <Jon625> @LilT0XiiC Finally someone gets it whats the point of playing MT when your team is jerking off on the side
[3:24:32] <silver6ird> hook btw
[3:24:38] <annunciationz> because a good mei will wall off every single suck hook combo
[3:24:40] <Nucklechutz> they just need to add another character that synergizes well with genji/ana or dva/winston, strengthen dive and you counter bunker/sniper

[3:25:01] <h0lden13> lol yeah lets just wait 3-4 monthws for that
[3:25:21] <h0lden13> genji=wirst dps maybe

[3:25:35] <Nucklechutz> pretty much, unless you're top tier
[3:25:38] <very6> nerf orisa someone make a petition 😂

[3:26:02] <very6> LUL
[3:26:04] <LoftyHunterStudios> yes, change your syphylis account
[3:26:06] <Nucklechutz> even at the top level he's essentially a vanity pick, he isn't really a hard counter for anything anymore
[3:26:09] <savy009> Whats the name of the show we used to watch with the tech guys and models??
[3:26:16] <annunciationz> Genji is fine. You're farming blade, then ask for nano and get some value out of it most of the time.

[3:26:23] <MuddyDuck> What happened to the other Face cam thing
[3:26:24] <replicantttv> Also, if the better Widow always won, Philly would have won playoffs in season one, but that’s not how it happened @h0lden13
[3:26:25] <annunciationz> not sure what also you want from genji?
[3:26:26] <h0lden13> @replicantttv exactly. she is worse than phara and mercy. one hero should not have that much powe
[3:26:35] <Nucklechutz> it's not to say he doesn't work
[3:26:49] <Nucklechutz> it's to say other dps do the job for less effort, mechanical demands
[3:27:01] <silver6ird> for a team with 3 dps you have a surprising lack of damage
[3:27:06] <h0lden13> @replicantttv yeah cuz ladder widows is like OWL
[3:27:10] <Nucklechutz> also, bring back triple jump,
[3:27:10] <very6> f
[3:27:14] <TIGERu> @silver6ird usually how it goes
[3:27:19] <terabyte06> i'm gonna miss all this creativity Kapp
[3:27:19] <LoftyHunterStudios> def ball next round
[3:27:20] <vortexcats> that feed from your team was embarrassing
[3:27:20] <Nucklechutz> his wall climb has been suspect ever since they "fixed" that
[3:27:26] <handsoappp> there was triple jump? @Nucklechutz
[3:27:28] <annunciationz> which other dps can kill 3-4 people in easily with nano?
[3:27:37] <vortexcats> PLAY BALL
[3:27:38] <Nucklechutz> you used to reset your double after a wall climb
[3:27:38] <annunciationz> you literally stay in the back and farm blade
[3:27:41] <sugarbeet> :)
[3:27:41] <silver6ird> @TIGERu FeelsQuickplayMan
[3:27:42] <h0lden13> soft nerf hanzo? soft nerf widow, only fair
[3:27:51] <handsoappp> danm
[3:27:52] <annunciationz> wheres the mechanical skill?
[3:27:56] <King_Binge> emongGood emongGood emongGood
[3:28:01] <silver6ird> honestly riley that's a mood
[3:28:06] <Nucklechutz> so you could double jump, wall climb, and then double jump again, and they nerfed that because he's "too hard to hit"
[3:28:23] <h0lden13> genji has more glitches than doom
[3:28:24] <very6> wtf
[3:28:26] <replicantttv> You didn’t say ‘on ladder’, you just said the better Widow wins, and that’s not always the case. In fact, it’s not always the case on ladder either, but she does require a lot to work around @h0lden13
[3:28:32] <very6> just aim 4head
[3:28:34] <LoftyHunterStudios> you can here the wild meta call
[3:28:48] <sugarbeet> meticUp we r going to win
[3:28:51] <Nucklechutz> now, if you slide off an object wrong and unknowingly double jump, you don't wall climb
[3:28:56] <h0lden13> @replicantttv i said the onyl counter to widow, is another widow
[3:29:31] <King_Binge> What about dive?
[3:29:40] <d_land> Frustration deteco
[3:29:47] <d_land> Detected
[3:29:55] <h0lden13> doesnt mean you need to always win the widow fight. but it ie the only real way to counter
[3:30:06] <Nucklechutz> dive counters widow
[3:30:12] <Nucklechutz> as long as you dive her
[3:30:24] <h0lden13> and she grapples to her tem
[3:30:32] <TIGERu> brig was on a mission then

[3:33:04] <LilT0XiiC> Phat hook
[3:33:06] <King_Binge> HOG COUNTERS WIDOW
[3:33:10] <sugarbeet> LULW
[3:33:13] <d_land> Pop off
[3:33:14] <replicantttv> Dive does counter Widow, but the value you get from just running Widow yourself and countering her that way is a bit higher, which is why I get what @h0lden13 is saying @nucklechutz
[3:33:22] <Slaprock> emongg best hooker NA HandsUp
[3:33:27] <LoftyHunterStudios> EPIC
[3:33:28] <hubspitz> Emongg carrying hard
[3:33:36] <Nucklechutz> if you have a better widow, yea
[3:33:51] <Hatsby> ANA STOP DRYPEEKING FFS OkayChamp
[3:33:59] <Nucklechutz> generally, if you have a better widow, then you've had her from the start
[3:34:06] <h0lden13> @replicantttv it can soft counter widow. i mean, widow is in dive a lot of the time..
[3:34:19] <vortexcats> ur team has a need4feed

[3:35:01] <h0lden13> and Doom
[3:35:21] <King_Binge> Imagine how bad it’s gonna be with Sims shield moving all over the place xD
[3:35:23] <replicantttv> Not even better necessarily, even being decent can be enough of a deterrent if your team plays correctly. Widow just does a lot on the map @nucklechutz
[3:35:24] <TIGERu> WHAT WAS THAT DRAGON
[3:35:27] <h0lden13> Hanzo, a sniper, gets a soft nerf, widow needs a nerf
[3:35:29] <Hatsby> got emm HAH
[3:35:47] <Jurgen___> Hello mr streamer, hello chat
[3:35:59] <King_Binge> *sigmas shield moving all over
[3:36:00] <h0lden13> Widow does too much on a lot of maps

[3:36:28] <vortexcats> "im died" LMAO
[3:36:30] <h0lden13> not even asking for much, just put her grapple cool down back up
[3:36:32] <Nucklechutz> at my level, if there's a troublesome widow on the other team, it means you don't have a widow main on your team, because gold widows hard instalock
[3:36:39] <vortexcats> what a game
[3:37:04] <QuantumPotat0> people complaining about a pure aim hero rewarding good aim in an FPS game is getting really old
[3:37:09] <LoftyHunterStudios> nice try. yu popped off. dps pooped off

[3:37:15] <replicantttv> They already increased it once, any more and she’s kinda trash @h0lden13
