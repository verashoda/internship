[0:03:48] <Elihentrix> LOL
[0:03:48] <Shumanigans> LUL
[0:03:50] <michingmallecho> So nothing is going to be announced at evo triFeels
[0:03:55] <Mewgusta> So no new Evo announcement.
[0:03:58] <rashidoo> and then he posted his dong in the DMs
[0:04:01] <rwells15> Don't show the trailer on stream. I haven't seen the trailer as yet!
[0:04:01] <rashidoo> classic mir prank
[0:04:06] <xlancealotx> So my theory is that this was a planned capcom leak and they are going to have way more to show us at evo.
[0:04:10] <justgaryhere> oh man... this day was fucking crazy
[0:04:15] <Elihentrix> there were new mechanics in the trailer
[0:04:16] <Joiztik> @VesperArcade 0.01% announcement at Evo
[0:04:21] <Lucks13> That's why they showed the trailer
[0:04:23] <kazamajinmishima> lol
[0:04:25] <ustinodj> @rashidoo classic mir
[0:04:27] <Lucks13> No way to hide that for 3 days
[0:04:33] <mike_the_greatest> leak c city baby
[0:04:36] <Daveski_215> They just put up all 3 individual trailers
[0:04:42] <GutterMagic> mind as well throw up the trailer
[0:04:46] <sonicnerd14> @vesperarcade Vesper vesperMouth
[0:04:46] <xlancealotx> Btw this leak is not impressive and so uninteresting
[0:04:48] <michingmallecho> Capcom released the kraken
[0:04:48] <Mewgusta> they just put the trailers on the official youtube
[0:04:48] <CheongMC> capcom released official trailers.
[0:04:55] <ustinodj> its not a leak anymore

[0:05:06] <ponchuffy> I liked them all 3 of them
[0:05:07] <Daveski_215> Lucia actually looks pretty dope
[0:05:10] <GrandMasterMingLee> imo cutting poisons hair was a bad move
[0:05:14] <michingmallecho> 3 characters released in one day is hype though capcomOhohoho capcomOhohoho
[0:05:16] <mike_the_greatest> they had better not have made us wait 10 months to announce a smaller season
[0:05:21] <sonicnerd14> @vesperarcade So do you think SFV is officially dead if 3 characters is all we get? KappaHD
[0:05:23] <Leoguimaraes89> I predict 3 chars: honda, lucia and poison Kappa

[0:17:10] <Skillz08> Lucia looks so generic
[0:17:11] <enzo152> BUT YOU PROMISED US SUPER SFV
[0:17:11] <Hulkbusterv3> balance patch don't need a trailer dummies
[0:17:11] <giigman> Did Vesper already watch it?
[0:17:12] <emyel> It goes from an Ohno to an Oro PogChamp
[0:17:15] <mattdiamond1982> so no update for kage, he's still hot garbage

[0:17:25] <RockmanX74> Yo Vesper! Long time no chat! How’ve you been?
[0:17:27] <mike_the_greatest> Honeslty if it's not a netcode patch I'm not even buying the characters
[0:17:28] <SquallAdv> Maybe it was "leaked" and Capcom have another big surprise for EVO, maybe MAKOTO <3
[0:17:29] <hayatesoe> season 4 needs auto combos
[0:17:31] <marcelino00> Man 3 characters at the same time,its a huge thing for the game
[0:17:31] <Seraphace> The weirdest thing is the least well received character (his implementation anyways) was final fight Cody. So what do they do? Release 2 more final fight characters
[0:17:31] <jay_belmont> I just want them to move on from SF5 and on to the next
[0:17:32] <enzo152> strangeGG strangeGG strangeGG strangeGG strangeGG strangeGG

[0:17:34] <gymbro4life> Capcom better show something else
[0:17:35] <coffintactics> 7 months for this ??? 3 characters!!!!
[0:17:35] <rashidoo> @VesperArcade lower your expectations
[0:17:35] <duck_helmet> Well, Big expansion for Monster Hunter.
[0:17:35] <GaleXylo> This is great and now Capcom can burn in shambles
[0:17:36] <xlancealotx> Ono is legit setting us up, he is going to show a 2nd trailer and everyone is going to go crazy. The winter bundle will be shown at evo!
[0:17:36] <SpaceDive> NotLikeThis this sucks
[0:17:37] <brosencephalon> no buffs for kage. feelsbadman
[0:17:38] <shawnu1111> depresssssedddf....

[0:17:39] <someguy_zero> Karin Nerf
[0:17:40] <vauxenn> "WE'LL DO IT DIFFERENTLY THIS YEAR" 3 chars released no core mechanics changed.
[0:17:41] <redhero1> There will be another trailer for Ryu
[0:17:41] <Guarddoge> vesperCaptain What do we do!
[0:17:43] <Showbiz54> Not with cpt
[0:17:44] <supersize567> 8 months for only 3 characters? I don't buy it. there must be more
[0:17:46] <ustinodj> MY FUCKIN NETCODE MAN
[0:17:49] <hayatesoe> F*CK CAPCOM
[0:17:49] <Pepe__Silva> If you need more characters than you don't really enjoy the game to begin with
[0:17:50] <wadjin> yeah like 8 months for 3 characters?
[0:17:51] <Helten__> SF5 died today BibleThump
[0:17:52] <jay_belmont> Sagat buffs lol
[0:17:53] <kazamajinmishima> what season 4?
[0:17:53] <Arryndosk_Raven> IT'S OVER! SHUT IT DOWN! SHUT IT DOWN!
[0:17:53] <lobo5003> let's hope he ain't coming cuz it ain't worth just announcing a balance patch. maybe maybe we still get it
[0:17:53] <white_lotus_84> No balance patch......too close to Capcom Cup
[0:17:54] <wakeupshoyu> Good I don’t need ono San mumbling about 3 characters and a stage / I’m happy for the leak ... idk -_-?
[0:18:00] <NeoKable_> CAN WE FUCKING GET AN ALEX TRAILER
[0:18:01] <itsPanic_> Like, did you really think they’d release a huge patch changing the game completely with new mechanics halfway through the season? That’s something they’d leave for the next season not a halfway season type thing.
[0:18:02] <hayatesoe> NO NEW NETCODE
[0:18:02] <khalz1998> @vesperarcade apparently this is summer package. and a Winter package is being revealed
[0:18:08] <Gamer_ninja_dxb> MAY BE ITS A TROLL AND CAPCOM DID THIS PURPOSELY AND THEY HAVE SOME THING ELSE FOR EVO
[0:18:10] <hayatesoe> NO NEW MECHANICS
[0:18:10] <SpaceDive> did you just find out now Vesper?
[0:18:11] <jay_belmont> yeah play our better games lol

[0:18:14] <mike_the_greatest> They updated SF4 netcode with ultra.
[0:18:15] <Guarddoge> Play MHW and DMCV you fucks -Capcom
[0:18:15] <GlennR> MH director is sabotaging the SF franchise ceroRage
[0:18:15] <hayatesoe> SF5 SUCKS
[0:18:17] <ustinodj> capcom not even gonna fly him out
[0:18:17] <brosencephalon> I can't believe they aren't giving us more. 8 months, of working hard. Now no ONO. this is crazy
[0:18:18] <someguy_zero> HE'S LYING Kappa
[0:18:18] <Linkashbr> I feel bad for Ono and for not having a patch
[0:18:18] <Helten__> Alex coming out soon?
[0:18:19] <GrinningOni> I'm really bummed about this, honestly.
[0:18:24] <JBMDoolio> @VesperArcade https://old.reddit.com/r/StreetFighter/comments/ckhtiq/so_this_guy_apparently_knows_whats_up_and_he/
[0:18:24] <akinohamlet> lol I really hope this isn't all there is to SF5's evo reveal
[0:18:25] <Elihentrix> @VesperArcade pls tell im not crazy, there are some crazy juggles for all 3 characters does this mean new combos for all character or is it just for them?
[0:18:27] <rfhc5> Unless he's lying, this is it
[0:18:30] <wisegreenwanderer> @Gamer_ninja_dxb no just no ,give it up already
[0:18:30] <Hulkbusterv3> leaker dude said winter bundle is coming

[0:18:39] <Skillz08> Its combofiends fault!
[0:18:43] <xlancealotx> This is a “summer bundle” and there will be a “winter bundle” with 3 more characters and balance changes
[0:18:43] <Halosoul96> waiting on that Tekken 7 leak and FighterZ Leak
[0:18:44] <RockmanX74> Maybe Ono is trolling

[0:18:46] <kazamajinmishima> he's updating Type Arcade now Kappa
[0:18:48] <Omfgis_herrera> Winter pack has oro
[0:18:48] <HumsterMKII> I strongly believe Ono told they there would be no point for him going to EVO2019
[0:18:48] <marcelino00> I for one rather they focus on developing the next entry,instead of completely reworking SFV to give it one more year tops
[0:18:49] <Repraved> The grasshoppers man...should have known what was coming
[0:18:51] <cjGRAYSON> hasan R knew

[0:23:41] <rfhc5> Like what's wrong with Capcom.
[0:23:42] <rfhc5> A part of me, blames the Capcom fanboys because they accept being treated like dirt, they eat whatever they get.
[0:23:42] <Miker1234> @lnn0minable cool Otacon wmote
[0:23:42] <solarxlipse> I'm dumbfounded right now
[0:23:43] <MakaSolo> I still think they are saving stuff, they just showed they are willing to sit on content
[0:23:44] <ponchuffy> Maybe they got cut on money
[0:23:46] <lobo5003> we only got 4 total compared to the 6 prior. weird man
[0:23:48] <thenoble_ali> People are loving these characters though. They look great.

[0:23:53] <LiquidSnke> @toemanjon11 all I can say is wait until EVO
[0:23:54] <snowfarmer81> seems like they are going to do it twice
[0:23:55] <khalz1998> something isnt right. also why didnt they do a SEASON PASS this year...🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
[0:23:57] <muenshter> because they want evo viewers to dogpile into the game
[0:23:57] <EmilioWK> Fake leak to reveal the true announcement later?
[0:23:58] <el_superking01> 8 months! duude...eff capcom
[0:23:59] <GaleXylo> Proves the current state of Capcom
[0:23:59] <paladinwings> I had a dream fei long was in sfv
[0:23:59] <ctrigger101> HAD to have been capcom USA VS JPN having some kind of internal dipute
[0:24:00] <da_closer6> no improved netcode?
[0:24:00] <KillorBeSlaughtered> He isnt salty
[0:24:02] <Showbiz54> They wanted to generate hype
[0:24:02] <nethstar> this is why SFV isn't going to change at all
[0:24:02] <KillorBeSlaughtered> He is fired
[0:24:03] <hennesyhufflepuf> WAKE UP CAPCOM @VesperArcade
[0:24:03] <Hologrammike> They probably didn't have the resources to do so
[0:24:06] <that_japanese_dude> Ono introducing the salt comeback mechanic in SFV

[0:24:25] <mujinkyaku> Why are we complaining about 3 new characters releaed this week? There's probably a balance patch too.
[0:24:26] <hayatesoe> He should give us X-Factor
[0:24:27] <Guarddoge> They didn't plan on doing new characters until Ono begged them to continue Season 4
[0:24:28] <FGCDisturbed> @VesperArcade you know that this is not the only reveal, right?
[0:24:28] <Fiji_G> I want it not to be true

[0:25:16] <Skillz08> Sagat and G were Hype though!
[0:25:16] <redhero1> Maybe I was dumb to think that the company that was A. doing so well with Resident Evil, Devil May Cry, Monster Hunter, hell even Megaman as of late B. blueballing their fanbase for 8 months to show off something at EVO C. DECONFIRMED SFVI would be able to show something good for SFV.
[0:25:17] <muenshter> They waited 8 months just to flub it a few days before
[0:25:18] <masakit11> @VesperArcade this can't be it.d there has to be more at evo BibleThump

[0:49:35] <KingK4zuma> It will effect akuma?
[0:49:35] <its_hugostiglitz> does honda have a kara command grab
[0:49:36] <Sickn3s> If all that was showed today if thats all capcom has this is a failure
[0:49:37] <AmineFifty> maybe next Season

[0:49:46] <muenshter> unless he's doing 40% health each hitconfirm
[0:49:46] <Beats_By_Noel_Brown> HOW DO YOU KILL WHAT IS ALREADY DEAD @VesperArcade LUL
[0:49:49] <duck_helmet> Honda gone a piss on Ryu
[0:49:49] <Sandman444a> like Blanka was to Abigail?
[0:49:50] <Dirty_Double_Crosser> The future AKA 8 more months of no news
[0:49:51] <Alexander_Heinz> Does he have a good reversal ?
[0:49:51] <lnn0minable> anti punk
[0:49:51] <Aspyre_FGC> I hope they're all fucking busted
[0:49:51] <someguy_zero> Punk's dead
[0:49:51] <johnieshabravo> Slap that bitch HONDA
[0:49:52] <lock__m> upper mid
[0:49:52] <infamous479> high mid tier
[0:49:54] <risemix> I wonder how his neutral is...
[0:49:54] <Linkashbr> @VesperArcade we need a balance patch to change anything in this game
[0:49:54] <SweetJP_TV> Depends not sure if he can outfooties her
[0:49:54] <eeega> Slap Karin outta meta pls
[0:49:56] <AfternoonConcession> almost top 10 but not top
[0:49:57] <Azrael_GT> seriously? cmonBruh
[0:49:57] <narleyboi> Ryu killer lol
[0:49:57] <Jailbird20022> I wanna see itabashi play hi,
[0:49:59] <Vzu_> just don't get CCed by him LUL
[0:49:59] <concretenj> Karin has problems against Birdie
[0:50:00] <mike_the_greatest> I mean Karin Mika is karin favored
[0:50:00] <Guarddoge> Stop doing this to Punk @VesperArcade
[0:50:05] <someguy_zero> Punk hopeless
[0:50:05] <xiaowa562> Abigail vt2
[0:50:06] <Haljegh> if honda's st.hk goes half screen like in sf4, he'll be mid tier
[0:50:06] <Mattchewd> yes
[0:50:07] <bigdon2284> Honda is the terminator
[0:50:08] <estarix> nah he'll get rocked by karin's cr mk
[0:50:08] <Dirty_Double_Crosser> SFV getting shaken up? LUL Kappa
[0:50:08] <freakyyyy8> After a balance patch maybe??? @VesperArcade
[0:50:10] <shawnu1111> I love his command throw.
[0:50:12] <big4lil> "what is this pose" LUL
[0:50:12] <wake_up_super> did he cancel command throw from stand heavy kick
[0:50:12] <NinoDiablo> No, I beat he has poor defence, and no reversal moves
[0:50:15] <CheongMC> Head butt probably not safe on block
[0:50:15] <thepiefoot> I wish Honda would slap Karin's head 180 degrees
[0:50:16] <mike_the_greatest> Sounds like you mean against brawlers, not grapplers?
[0:50:16] <Beats_By_Noel_Brown> WHAT IS DEAD MAY NEVER DIE bovThrow
[0:50:16] <Dirty_Double_Crosser> SFV will never change.
[0:50:17] <rashidoo> we won't know until we see the frame data and hitboxes
[0:50:18] <michingmallecho> Honda being a counter pick to Karin triGiggle triGiggle
[0:50:20] <IamRubeZ> Looks like all Uriens main going to E honda. Kappa
[0:50:22] <fuzzyrpg> isn't Bonchan Karin Senpai atm tho?
[0:50:23] <Lethalaura2_0> What’s his hp?
[0:50:23] <yunggrasshopper77> @vesperarcade ohhhh you have footage!
[0:50:27] <rashidoo> he might turn out to be like blanka where his neutral is wack
[0:50:27] <Seraphace> His super is a little unimaginative
[0:50:27] <pinkdolphin95> He’s cool. 8.5/10
[0:50:28] <SweetJP_TV> ya but thats cuz they have longer range nuetral tools
[0:50:28] <Haljegh> @michingmallecho ohoho
[0:50:29] <UrOpponent> 8 months, there has to b more than just these 3 characters
[0:50:29] <icemanblues> Honda probably not top tier. Rush down characters will put baby in the corner
[0:50:31] <Kristoffers> new honda design is a 2
[0:50:31] <Oortcloud9> Analyze the Honda vs Fang match up.
[0:50:33] <Llesor> sure
[0:50:33] <big4lil> muscle jiggle Kreygasm
[0:50:33] <ctrigger101> OF COURSE
[0:50:35] <MrRyuchi> 0-10
[0:50:36] <SweetJP_TV> it dam well better
[0:50:36] <enzo152> that would be SICK
[0:50:37] <wadjin> WHAT YOU GOT AGAINST KARIN?
[0:50:37] <AdmiralAckbars_Snackbar> no
[0:50:37] <Beats_By_Noel_Brown> Gonna guess Honda is 1050
[0:50:39] <muenshter> I think Honda's damage output is what really matters
[0:50:39] <snowfarmer81> i think it would be good against iut
[0:50:39] <F3scorn> 1050 hp I'm guessing
[0:50:42] <wetworker> PC Mod
[0:50:42] <Haljegh> headbutt -2
[0:50:42] <muenshter> rather than his buttons
[0:50:43] <Hologrammike> The VT1 headbutt hits on startup?
[0:50:44] <DissidiaNTUltimeciaMain> i just wany Falke buffs
[0:50:44] <KidSynergy> may trade
[0:50:45] <Beats_By_Noel_Brown> or 1025 since SFV is wonk city
[0:50:47] <Sundett> Lol Akuma would just v trigger activate and DP the headbutt midair
[0:50:47] <wadjin> sorry for caps
[0:50:48] <RockmanX74> Laura?
[0:50:49] <patpoker10> smell the armpits
[0:50:49] <Genius> Honda will be mid-tier, not more
[0:50:51] <Haljegh> ex hands are plus Kappa
[0:50:52] <big4lil> make him a thicc 1075
[0:50:52] <ctrigger101> 1050
[0:50:53] <GaleXylo> - 6 on block
[0:50:54] <wetworker> yes
[0:50:54] <Llesor> 1025
[0:50:54] <mujinkyaku> 1025
[0:50:55] <Sandman444a> 1000 at most
[0:50:56] <giigman> all depends on how much damage he does
[0:50:56] <freakyyyy8> 1000
[0:50:59] <KingK4zuma> It will surely beat his demon flip
[0:51:00] <duck_helmet> 1100
[0:51:00] <SweetJP_TV> what does gief have
[0:51:00] <Alpha_Bee> nah 1050 or 1025 at best
[0:51:00] <bigdon2284> Honda bodied by top tiers. He’s mid at best
[0:51:00] <nickmeistersa> isn't abigal 1050?
[0:51:00] <Hulkbusterv3> thicc boy
[0:51:01] <dharlf> 1025
[0:51:01] <its_hugostiglitz> honda has a kara command grab wtf
[0:51:01] <JauneArc> Blanka ball is punishable
[0:51:02] <mike_the_greatest> if they don't give honda more HP than ryu I'm unsubbing Kappa
[0:51:02] <giigman> i say 1025
[0:51:04] <risemix> I mean...kage looked good too.
[0:51:05] <Bunky0696> 1025
[0:51:07] <grumpyillegal> julian24Pog julian24Pog

[0:51:09] <Dirty_Double_Crosser> 1001 HP
[0:51:11] <Marquicedabeast> And what everything is on block
[0:51:12] <Beats_By_Noel_Brown> Honda prob has pixie health like 700 @VesperArcade
[0:51:13] <freakyyyy8> NEXT!
[0:51:13] <someguy_zero> E. Honda is Japan's saving grave PogChamp
[0:51:14] <NinoDiablo> Honda still wears red underwear
[0:51:14] <johnieshabravo> 1050 Kreygasm
[0:51:15] <big4lil> @risemix EXACTLY
[0:51:15] <Haljegh> 1050
[0:51:15] <michingmallecho> 1040
[0:51:15] <foxide_> why does poison look so weird
[0:51:17] <blackgeeky> 1100 Kappa
[0:51:18] <ObZen_Ov_Nile> 1025 tops
[0:51:19] <SweetJP_TV> Depends if the splace is a reversal
[0:51:21] <pinkdolphin95> 1025 that’s how much health he has.
[0:51:23] <LiquidSnke> But it's only 50 more OpieOP
[0:51:24] <H0M1C1DALMANYAC> 1500 hp
[0:51:24] <nightwing1936> they show off costumes at the end of the trailers @VesperArcade
[0:51:27] <rashidoo> the G of season 4
[0:51:27] <yunggrasshopper77> Honda should have 1025
[0:51:28] <Tippy_OD> I definitely think he hits REALLY hard @VesperArcade He just seems like that kinda character

[1:04:21] <dharlf> she is comming to get Kage and Falkie place on the low tier
[1:04:21] <SaltiestAlex> C A G E
[1:04:22] <TrojanAg> Vesper has lost all street cred
[1:04:22] <thepiefoot> This char will be played as much as Flake
[1:04:23] <Oortcloud9> Punk is winning EVO 2020 with Lucia.
[1:04:23] <okishop> thats what they said about akuma @VesperArcade
[1:04:24] <thecheeze09> Kage is good bro
[1:04:25] <Dirty_Double_Crosser> fireball super slow to get it out
[1:04:26] <sa1k0> "lowtier" This character will make future top 8
[1:04:26] <Hulkbusterv3> top tier confirm then

[1:04:27] <trevofour> whose cage
[1:04:28] <metalguy86> all 3 characters looked mid, low tier. even E Honda looks mid tier at best.
[1:04:28] <AlexIIDX> Daigo said he's switch to Lucia
[1:04:29] <giigman> She has runs and and bushin tatsu- she's a new guy
[1:04:29] <NinoDiablo> She looks like she plays similar to other characters

[1:04:37] <elmomight69her> "everything's probably super minus" LMAOOO
[1:04:37] <CheongMC> Her fireball may neglect 2 projectiles
[1:04:38] <yunggrasshopper77> Kage is not the worst
[1:04:39] <highfivepotater> so she is worse than juri
[1:04:40] <leafretv> its clearly overhead
[1:04:42] <paladinwings> Looks like she should have been c viper
[1:04:42] <leandrohenriques1983> vesper never played FF

[1:41:24] <8PoOryGone8> who is falke? Kappa
[1:41:24] <Genius> no new ingame mechanics
[1:41:24] <mike_the_greatest> The AA one?
[1:41:27] <Azrael_GT> @Yamsandjams neko is cat, the other is i don't know
[1:41:27] <dragonquestfan_> axe kick
[1:41:28] <Hulkbusterv3> Zeku theme Kreygasm Kreygasm
[1:41:33] <reoayanami> long range hk.
[1:41:34] <Tippy_OD> Charge character PogChamp
[1:41:47] <rasuicr> Neko damashi is a slap in front of your opponents face
[1:41:48] <reoayanami> since there is no proximity normal in sfv
[1:41:52] <rasuicr> to startle them
[1:41:57] <smellybeetle> This was deliberately leaked to not take away any momentum for the incoming SF6 teaser
[1:42:02] <rashidoo> nice
[1:42:03] <rashidoo> good shit
[1:42:03] <Haljegh> super is qcf WutFace
[1:42:06] <Azrael_GT> @Yamsandjams Deceiving Cat

[1:42:07] <KillJoyChief> Yo I'm more excited about the zeku theme that just started playing than I'm excited for Lucia.
[1:42:12] <omari1998> Honda's just a Blanka clone
[1:42:14] <F3scorn> HIGH EXECUTION CHARACTER
[1:42:14] <RagingMarmot> standard Honda
[1:42:16] <mujinkyaku> but it's 4 taps
[1:42:17] <Aspyre_FGC> Piano? You mean hitbox
[1:42:19] <Bunky0696> PogChamp
[1:42:20] <AdjustKiefer> But how you EX that?
[1:42:26] <8PoOryGone8> yeah this is no leak at all if these are available LUL
[1:42:28] <DomadorMilagroso> Is Honda a charge character in this game?
[1:42:33] <emp_cara_delevingne> only for mike ross Kappa
[1:42:39] <Time_pants> wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait there's sf5 leax
[1:42:40] <pinkdolphin95> 2 punches @adjustkiefer
[1:42:41] <yunggrasshopper77> I didn’t see piano only
[1:42:42] <F3scorn> @AdjustKiefer you would hit 3 punch buttons in a row and the final press would be 2 at the same time
[1:42:43] <GuySoGenerous> Command grab not a 360 like Gief PogChamp
[1:42:44] <HeavenIy_Demon> @8poorygone8 that's what I'm saying LUL
[1:42:47] <Seraphace> Aspyre_FGC A hitbox would make zero difference
[1:42:51] <F3scorn> Unless you only needed 4 punches
[1:42:51] <reoayanami> can't wait for Honda to down back the whole match
[1:42:53] <GaleXylo> itabashi zangief will be best Honda
[1:42:55] <rashidoo> honestly it kinda sux that there's nothing really new in his design
[1:42:55] <F3scorn> then subtract 1
[1:43:02] <rasuicr> 2 punches on last input = ex
[1:43:02] <yunggrasshopper77> The netcode is getting worst
[1:43:02] <Azrael_GT> nice, that's awesome
[1:43:05] <big4lil> fuck honda
[1:43:07] <rashidoo> everyone got a sf5 revamp but honda is about the same
[1:43:07] <cjGRAYSON> HAND SLAP IN LAG
[1:43:10] <Aspyre_FGC> @Seraphace oh right LUL
[1:43:14] <Sickn3s> It prob won't be 5 button input prob 4 punches
[1:43:14] <AdjustKiefer> @F3scorn Oh good lord. Thanks for the info
[1:43:17] <reoayanami> the CA is a motion, so that's new
[1:43:17] <duck_helmet> 1050 health is good though
[1:43:18] <Llesor> @rashidoo they mix and match the more traditional ones and revamped classic

[1:43:45] <DomadorMilagroso> Lucia is SO generical. Worst character
[1:43:52] <rashidoo> i guess i was expecting more cuz the traditional ones were released at the beginning
[1:43:52] <cjGRAYSON> vt1 3 bars
[1:43:56] <cjGRAYSON> vt 2 2 bars
[1:43:57] <trumyolo> Hail Hydra LUL
