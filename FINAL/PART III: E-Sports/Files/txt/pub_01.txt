[3:19:01] <pigglywiggly91> bluddSS bluddSS bluddSS bluddSS bluddSS
[3:19:03] <McKennza> head shots were bad
[3:19:03] <nukulus54> the lack of revive hurts
[3:19:05] <Penhassin> zombies need a buff
[3:19:10] <TrainedTREX> @chocoTaco headhsots on punches are so hard
[3:19:10] <epillon21> yikes. not even close
[3:19:12] <MotoSoul_> Can't work that with no damage there
[3:19:15] <niveler> 1x dmg for hs would be fair
[3:19:16] <jujujubes> dude, not the zombie's fault, that was a super IMBA weapon selection and damage setting
[3:19:17] <iceberry0204> too ez
[3:19:19] <FlatsKING> that was terrible circle
[3:19:23] <jermmsy> head shots with punches are impossible
[3:19:25] <jeffdizle> i think it was headshot only for zombies too
[3:19:25] <lumbertaz> not fair it being headshot only for zombies
[3:19:26] <CamiK22> chocotNice chocotOW chocotOW chocotOW chocotOW
[3:19:29] <LesPaulJeff> @PirateTuna For MVP
[3:19:30] <its_morganus> you should increase punch damage on the zombies
[3:19:31] <jeffdizle> so zombies had to punch heads
[3:19:31] <HackzSaw> zombies have to headshot as well
[3:19:33] <1duhrfool> 1duhrfool subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 12 months! Humans are too packed
[3:19:35] <jeffdizle> like impossible
[3:19:37] <blanko_ninyo> problem was you had to headshot punch as a zombie - which was not possible
[3:19:39] <FlatsKING> headshot only for zombies ruined it
[3:19:40] <Amanda2> 12 months PogChamp chocotSub chocotOhbaby
[3:19:41] <pauley821> need to lower headshot damage and increase melee
[3:19:41] <Bloxymoron_> full auto and 5x damage multiplier was a little much
[3:19:42] <HackzSaw> @jeffdizle yes
[3:19:44] <HellsauWOT> oh, headshot punches only is impossible lol
[3:19:44] <octospock> yeah headshot punches was hard
[3:19:45] <mabdeno> too much Ammo, need to restrict that to make it fair
[3:19:46] <CamiK22> chocotEZ chocotEZ chocotGG chocotGG
[3:19:47] <baupow> fewer humans maybe?
[3:19:48] <patrixmith> sanhok is great for zombies
[3:19:50] <TrainedTREX> @chocoTaco just no headshots on zombies
[3:19:53] <rodriquezzz1905> we cant hit the humans look at their healths its not fair
[3:19:56] <Amanda2> lower damage @chocoTaco
[3:19:56] <f00bz> @chocotaco run it again and lead the zombies to victory!
[3:19:57] <walid_ceza> where in the fog ?
[3:19:57] <The_Gamingverse> you need to give us a zombie discord channel
[3:19:57] <McKennza> no head shots
[3:19:58] <p1dusty> can zombies ledge grab too?
[3:19:59] <zonalcracker> zombies should just have better melee damage
[3:19:59] <Cleartrax> Rain and Fog on
[3:20:00] <bobdole3780> turn the fog on
[3:20:00] <jermmsy> turn off headshots only
[3:20:01] <JJS_11> Only headshots for zombies.... Thought we had a chance. LUL
[3:20:08] <Like13Pirates> @chocoTaco it was hard for the zombies to headshot
[3:20:09] <its_morganus> yeah when he stated headshot only that includes all damage
[3:20:17] <supraxpasha> zombies needs a buff

No advertising. 4. Don't import trouble or arguments. This chat is not the place for it. 5. English chat only, please. 6. No spamming 7. Mods are the final arbiters of what is or isn't appropriate. Thank you!
[4:44:24] <wkwkwadhidhiw> swap s12k with Winchester
