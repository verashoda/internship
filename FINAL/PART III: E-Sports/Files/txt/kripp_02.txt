[0:05:29] <Nightbot> krippCash You earn 1 Lettuce every 15 min just by watching! Then use that Lettuce to bet on Arena. To bet, just type !bet (low, mid, high) (1 - 100), for example !bet mid 50 wagers 50 Lettuce on 6 - 8 wins. Winners get their bet back and split 2x the losers' bets, divided based on how much they personally bet. You can type !lettuce in chat to have Streamlabs whisper your Lettuce to you! krippCash

[0:26:59] <Nightbot> krippCash You earn 1 Lettuce every 15 min just by watching! Then use that Lettuce to bet on Arena. To bet, just type !bet (low, mid, high) (1 - 100), for example !bet mid 50 wagers 50 Lettuce on 6 - 8 wins. Winners get their bet back and split 2x the losers' bets, divided based on how much they personally bet. You can type !lettuce in chat to have Streamlabs whisper your Lettuce to you! krippCash

[0:36:58] <Alucard4469> @nl_Kripp What about an arena tournament where every deck score was predetermined and the player knew that by picking a good card there would be less of a chance of getting other good cards going forward. This would ensure varied but balanced power level decks, and would allow for competitive arena.

To bet, just type !bet (low, mid, high) (1 - 100), for example !bet mid 50 wagers 50 Lettuce on 6 - 8 wins. Winners get their bet back and split 2x the losers' bets, divided based on how much they personally bet. You can type !lettuce in chat to have Streamlabs whisper your Lettuce to you! krippCash

[0:53:37] <panic4> For me, it’s the McChicken. The best fast food sandwich. I even ask for extra McChicken sauce packets and the staff is so friendly and more than willing to oblige. One time I asked for McChicken sauce packets and they gave me three. I said, “Wow, three for free!” and the nice friendly McDonald’s worker laughed and said, “I’m going to call you 3-for-free!”. Now the staff greets me with “hey it’s 3-for-free!” and ALWAYS give me three packets. It’s such a fun and cool atmosphere at my local McDonal

[1:02:33] <Nightbot> krippCash You earn 1 Lettuce every 15 min just by watching! Then use that Lettuce to bet on Arena. To bet, just type !bet (low, mid, high) (1 - 100), for example !bet mid 50 wagers 50 Lettuce on 6 - 8 wins. Winners get their bet back and split 2x the losers' bets, divided based on how much they personally bet. You can type !lettuce in chat to have Streamlabs whisper your Lettuce to you! krippCash

To bet, just type !bet (low, mid, high) (1 - 100), for example !bet mid 50 wagers 50 Lettuce on 6 - 8 wins. Winners get their bet back and split 2x the losers' bets, divided based on how much they personally bet. You can type !lettuce in chat to have Streamlabs whisper your Lettuce to you! krippCash

To bet, just type !bet (low, mid, high) (1 - 100), for example !bet mid 50 wagers 50 Lettuce on 6 - 8 wins. Winners get their bet back and split 2x the losers' bets, divided based on how much they personally bet. You can type !lettuce in chat to have Streamlabs whisper your Lettuce to you! krippCash

[2:04:19] <tc3191> So you're going by "Octavian" now plebian? Haha what's up spurcifer, it's Tannerius from Rome. Remember me? Me and the other legionaries used to give you a hard time. Sorry you were just an easy target. I can see not much has changed. Remember Seira, the girl you had a crush on? Yeah, she's my concubine now. I make over 200 sesterces a year and drive a quadriga chariot. I guess some things never change huh? Nice catching up. Patheticus.

[3:14:39] <Nightbot> krippCash You earn 1 Lettuce every 15 min just by watching! Then use that Lettuce to bet on Arena. To bet, just type !bet (low, mid, high) (1 - 100), for example !bet mid 50 wagers 50 Lettuce on 6 - 8 wins. Winners get their bet back and split 2x the losers' bets, divided based on how much they personally bet. You can type !lettuce in chat to have Streamlabs whisper your Lettuce to you! krippCash

[3:20:31] <Nightbot> krippCash You earn 1 Lettuce every 15 min just by watching! Then use that Lettuce to bet on Arena. To bet, just type !bet (low, mid, high) (1 - 100), for example !bet mid 50 wagers 50 Lettuce on 6 - 8 wins. Winners get their bet back and split 2x the losers' bets, divided based on how much they personally bet. You can type !lettuce in chat to have Streamlabs whisper your Lettuce to you! krippCash
