[0:16:36] <Deimos002> It's not hard being cooler Ken tho
[0:16:39] <Siethasay> Actually he is pretty tall. Taller than Ryu. Do Honda's taunt and he towers over Ryu.

[0:17:23] <NaoeShigen> I *just* realized that she has sunglasses on top of her hat. O.o
[0:17:23] <kcomplex1> Lucia hello @vesperarcade streaming earlier today I see
[0:17:24] <finitude_> It should be mandatory for Urien to wear the banana hammock in Honda's stage.
[0:17:24] <KiddThunderr> he's probably the tallest Japanse person ever
[0:17:31] <official_nakmatic> 420 viewers
[0:17:37] <sa1k0> challenge Sonicsol to a FT10 using the new characters @vesperarcade CoolCat

[0:17:47] <GaleXylo> Jotaro @KiddThunderr
[0:17:51] <8PoOryGone8> @NaoeShigen its the same glasses of Guile too
[0:17:57] <KiddThunderr> Oh I forgot about Jotaro
[0:18:02] <Siethasay> Since we got Honda's stage in the game, everybody should have a spa outfit. Do it Capcom. Make all the moneys.

[0:18:45] <LethalweaponLord> Hey vesper i thought you weren't touching this character until the better characters were learned LUL
[0:18:46] <GaleXylo> Honda's story mode might be the best in the game
[0:18:46] <DeviantSuicune> i didnt see that throw
[0:18:48] <official_nakmatic> holy moly monkaS
[0:18:48] <evil_ryuko> Would Lucia be worth getting a starting off the game with? New player here :)

[0:19:04] <Powersurge145> Powersurge145 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months! 
[0:19:04] <FalcieGaiah> @YujiSenpai thanks!
[0:19:13] <HapZungLam> st.hp is the best st.hp of all shoto (maybe not akuma)
[0:19:17] <yogsagat> @GaleXylo Honda's story had so much to offer in the whole SFV Story.
[0:19:30] <Robbandoran> Lucias kick is really good btw. If you space it no1 can punish it and it dodges low attacks
[0:19:32] <YujiSenpai> shes around the same level as sakura actually in terms of teirs
[0:19:34] <zilul> she remind me of SF4 Juri
[0:19:42] <yogsagat> @GaleXylo And we got to see some Rashid action.
[0:19:51] <T_a_s_e> how is she even remotely similar to sf4 juri @zilul
[0:19:53] <Siethasay> I think Lucia is pretty easy to play and I would go ahead and mess with her if you are a new player. But try not to get confused with her moveset as there seems to be a good amount of cancels.
[0:19:53] <DeviantSuicune> damn
[0:19:53] <grumpe01> shes been out for hours and fools already talking tier lists
[0:19:55] <GaleXylo> @yogsagat lool rashid.
[0:20:03] <YujiSenpai> aleast first impressions wise
[0:20:13] <8PoOryGone8> @grumpe01 ikr

[0:20:37] <zilul> @T_a_s_e maybe her fireball

[0:20:55] <dotafan2881> unga
[0:20:57] <yogsagat> @GaleXylo Only if we got that tornado.
[0:20:59] <YujiSenpai> @grumpe01 im saying as a first impression not actually place her on a tier list i main sakura so i dont care about tiers

[0:22:02] <Siethasay> Anybody know if any pros are switching to any of the 3 new characters?
[0:22:07] <yogsagat> @GaleXylo Should have got Some more Ryu Action.

[0:22:32] <Goober707> What's the general day 2 consensus of each character?
[0:22:39] <yogsagat> @GaleXylo Juri ok going out with the other girls?
[0:22:40] <69DongerSwag420> NotLikeThis
[0:22:40] <8PoOryGone8> itabashi likes honda
[0:22:47] <Gimme_Makoto> @Goober707 Same as day one. It's still too early
[0:22:51] <Siethasay> LOL. I mean people have been craving Bonchan to play Sagat. And EVO 2019 he uses him throughout.
[0:22:53] <Gimme_Makoto> @Goober707 All seem good
[0:23:15] <8PoOryGone8> Hondo is unga bunga
[0:23:21] <yogsagat> How's Lucia
[0:23:24] <8PoOryGone8> Honda
[0:23:25] <GaleXylo> @yogsagat yasss. Just needed Karin to be his story mode and It'd be 11/10
[0:23:26] <shawnu1111> hey vesp. you Hated lucia. how about know?
[0:23:27] <69DongerSwag420> you can loop it then
[0:23:29] <tdotprops> why do a lot of the female characters say "right there!"?
[0:23:31] <HapZungLam> why not just st.hp and run
[0:23:33] <Miker1234> @siethasay well because he already wanted to play Sagat even if he could even be bottom tier
[0:23:38] <yogsagat> @GaleXylo Yes.
[0:23:47] <Hado_Fan> Hey everyone

[0:24:06] <YujiSenpai> you can run after st.mp
[0:24:08] <Siethasay> I understand that. Does that logic not apply to veteran SF players wanting to play Honda or Poison?
[0:24:10] <Llesor> D: fatshaming

[0:37:08] <big4lil> claw is so unprivileged lol
[0:37:09] <Mecha_G> does Poison have a Roxy color palette?
[0:37:18] <CHAMPION410> Are you going to use the piano technique with honda or slide because of one less input (4inputs) for hands @vesperarcade
[0:37:18] <cuckingbythebook> @vesperarcade crmk*

[0:39:45] <Daltimond> jesus she has a tatsu?
[0:39:50] <mabataki87> every one loves her already.. this is the power of Capcom...
[0:39:54] <JMDurden> Lucia is cute and the New York accent is cute. Everything else, I don't care about. jmdurdSmug
[0:39:54] <Miker1234> maybe a command grab

[0:41:11] <grimeyyow> @VesperArcade whh no honda :(((
[0:41:15] <Mecha_G> I think NRS was overcompensating because all of the female characters looked like strippers/porn stars in MK9
[0:41:17] <Gliscorman1> I can't rank her up, too much teleporting lag
[0:41:18] <yogsagat> Lucia and Honda is the Double Queen

[0:42:52] <sneakytoes> does she have to do the whole fireball kick or can she fake it
[0:42:55] <nethstar> this CC fishing

[0:43:51] <muenshter> hit em with the overhead
[0:43:51] <N1njaguy96> They need to put Law form Tekken in SFV Kreygasm

[0:44:04] <Daltimond> dude that fireball seems like it can make some tricky setups
[0:44:06] <ifernoian> that fireball setup is so strong lol
[0:44:06] <big4lil> so her pressure is real?
[0:44:08] <official_nakmatic> Lucia is BEAST
[0:44:10] <cuckingbythebook> what's this fake ass run pressure vesper is doing? no wonder he's losing to a silver birdie Kappa
[0:44:11] <DeviantSuicune> i guess he gave up

[0:44:22] <FalcieGaiah> @VesperArcade idk if you are put an advantage that's why I'm asking, noone seems to be using it
[0:44:23] <Sandman444a> @VesperArcade What's the aim for Lucia? Platinum or Master?
[0:44:28] <donutz321> is her cr.mp good?
[0:44:28] <yogsagat> @VesperArcade She's rush down fang
[0:44:28] <nacl_warrior> So degenerate
[0:44:30] <LayaDR> broken character
[0:44:38] <rfhc5> Cheer8 Its been 8 months, really miss this serious of ranking up with new characters.
[0:44:38] <Miker1234> day 2
[0:44:39] <itz_daedae> is she still your fave character??
[0:44:41] <mtlwolf_> she's super trash
[0:44:43] <duck_helmet> Lucia? I thought you were gonna pass on Lucia.
[0:44:46] <Mecha_G> that v-skill is straight out of Final Fight 3
[0:44:48] <mtlwolf_> ultimate trash character
[0:44:49] <someguy_zero> Fun to play, but probably not tournament-tier
[0:44:50] <rfhc5> series*
[0:44:53] <mtlwolf_> from day 1
[0:44:56] <Llesor> fchamp said she's good
[0:45:01] <LayaDR> top tier character
[0:45:03] <ifernoian> just wait desk comes up with combo videos for all 3 characters

[0:45:21] <HapZungLam> Whats her bnb?
[0:45:23] <khalz1998> @ifernoian hes already done one for honda lol
[0:45:23] <Johnsoni7> fchamp aint shhen no more
[0:45:27] <Miker1234> remember Kage smurf Vesper? i don't want to
[0:45:30] <that_japanese_dude> @VesperArcade Do you think Capcom opted to do things differntly this time because they wanted equal development time for these 3 characters?
[0:45:38] <someguy_zero> Fchamp is alive? LUL
[0:45:38] <gregcanela> looks like she has the tools to be good
[0:45:41] <rfhc5> @Miker1234 That was funny lol
[0:45:44] <yogsagat> @VesperArcade Will they bounce like your checks did back in the day?
[0:45:46] <HapZungLam> thanks
[0:45:50] <ghostfrom3rdstrike> I'm Here For Edmond Siiting On Vesper, Sorry Dude @vesperarcade reoBoon
[0:45:51] <miekruss> fchamp hates this garbage game LUL
[0:45:52] <YomoTheWanderer> so you're making new account for all three? @vesperarcade
[0:45:55] <sneakytoes> I think poison sucks
[0:45:56] <Miker1234> @rfhc5 fun and horrible at the same time
[0:46:02] <YomoTheWanderer> accounts
[0:46:05] <yogsagat> @sneakytoes Awww
[0:46:06] <ifernoian> how do you get enough fight money to buy them... buy with real money?
[0:46:07] <mtlwolf_> poison is pretty good
[0:46:16] <VTriggered612> no one gives the new characters a chance so they don't progress. that's why Japan doesn't even know where to put Cody on the tier list still after a year of him being available.
[0:46:16] <glovecold> Nice combos
[0:46:18] <lucidowo> Lucia EZ diamond
[0:46:18] <miekruss> you dont get enuff fight money
[0:46:19] <someguy_zero> Top 8 Hondas, Karins, Rashids next tourney
[0:46:20] <YomoTheWanderer> damn son
[0:46:21] <muenshter> can barely recognize that character lol
[0:46:24] <cuckingbythebook> poison has some good shit
[0:46:24] <8PoOryGone8> fchamp streaming mvc3 analysis, pretty good stream he teaching good stuff
[0:46:28] <iruntrees> so is cr.lp 3 fr

[0:46:41] <michingmallecho> Honda stun damage though ScaredyCat ScaredyCat
[0:46:43] <ShadowChaolan> How much HP does Lucia have?

[0:46:50] <Gimme_Makoto> @ShadowChaolan 950
[0:46:50] <akinohamlet> stuck with trash netcode LUL
[0:46:53] <ifernoian> can't play them.. not enough fight money man... :( sad
[0:46:55] <Guarddoge> The other smurf account better be called Sumobathwater
[0:46:56] <big4lil> just be honest with folks lol
[0:46:58] <NinoDiablo> I think it was because of SFV Type Arcade
[0:47:04] <DeviantSuicune> honestly poison seems like she's missing something
[0:47:07] <lucidowo> honestly i think they could make these guys ever 2 months TBH.
[0:47:10] <tvspec> i think they are doing sf6
[0:47:12] <rfhc5> LUL
[0:47:12] <thecheeze09> they were balanced right out of the gate, so there is no need to re-balance the entire cast
[0:47:14] <miekruss> a c0ck @DeviantSuicune ???
[0:47:22] <mtlwolf_> season 5 ? where did season 4 happened ?
[0:47:24] <NinoDiablo> Percentage Chance of Season 5?
[0:47:25] <baleiro> doesn't make sense mechanic changes in middle of CPT
[0:47:28] <akinohamlet> anyone else thinks Lucia is broken? Kappa
[0:47:31] <miekruss> there is no more seasons LUL
[0:47:31] <nacl_warrior> Shit just doesnt add up
[0:47:33] <8PoOryGone8> yeah the hype they build up through the months are not worth it
[0:47:34] <Gimme_Makoto> @mtlwolf_ Right now, this is season 4
[0:47:36] <miekruss> they are just gunna do 3 summer, 3 winter
[0:47:37] <Miker1234> @miekruss you are on fire man
[0:47:38] <ddtyson859> Sf community is toxic. Can’t make them happy smh
[0:47:39] <mtlwolf_> o
[0:47:40] <michingmallecho> Arrest that man
[0:47:41] <muenshter> Yeah i wouldn't call this a "season" like they've been before
[0:47:42] <someguy_zero> I love that anti-air DP Kreygasm
[0:47:43] <khalz1998> Super SFV will be shown in december to start of season 5. but something is also being shown in november ono said big news Nov + Dec🤔
[0:47:44] <yogsagat> Wow Bullying the Abigale.
[0:47:45] <NinoDiablo> Season 5, Last Season.
[0:47:53] <muenshter> but they're "seaosonal" waves
[0:47:54] <gregcanela> Police brutality
[0:47:59] <miekruss> whens sf4 LUL
[0:48:03] <Goober707> How negative is run cancel, is it as bad as Ken's?
[0:48:08] <muenshter> as in seasons of the year
[0:48:14] <FalcieGaiah> They also said big news coming at evo and all we got was 3 characters, that's not big news imo Kappa
[0:48:14] <big4lil> i dont think SFV or Tekken 7 needs more characters after 2019
[0:48:22] <miekruss> nah sfv needs to die
[0:48:26] <michingmallecho> Imagine a character or two right in November before CapCup capcomSagat capcomSagat
[0:48:29] <miekruss> and bring out sf6 and mvc4
[0:48:33] <Llesor> imagine coming to a SFV stream
[0:48:34] <glovecold> This police brutality gotta stop. That woman could’ve killed that large man with her bare hands
[0:48:35] <someguy_zero> I didn't you know you could kick the fireball twice for further range PogChamp
[0:48:38] <Llesor> and complaining about the game
[0:48:40] <AodSnarf> any opinion on Lucia as of now Vesper?
[0:48:45] <thecheeze09> not gonna lie, zafina looks damn good in tekken 7. Never looked this good
[0:48:47] <Linkashbr> cant do much at EVO, you cant add new mechanics during the pro season
[0:48:47] <itzLCD> I am extremely disappointed there was no balance patch, Capcom Cup isn't for another 5 months. We had time for one, now I have no reason to play :/
[0:48:48] <yogsagat> Clever Girl.
[0:48:50] <miekruss> imagine coming to a SFV stream ... shoulda stopped there @Llesor
[0:48:52] <Armagetz89> its -6 at best
[0:48:58] <ddtyson859> Lol right. Told you toxic

[1:32:46] <akaJoness> Honda VT2 = ohh look you are randomly in the corner ... ohh look you are dead
[1:32:47] <ustinodj> maybe lucia was gonna be sean with soccer balls but they changed the design last minute

[1:32:57] <burmymaster> honda's stage so pretty
[1:32:59] <rashidoo> i think fierce headbutt is the antiair
[1:33:03] <mtlwolf_> I wonder if she has an instant overhead
[1:33:04] <ron_plata> what does birdie say when he loses?
[1:33:05] <LaLiLuLeLolz> Lucia has the best anti air of the 3 I feel
[1:33:16] <Miker1234> @rashidoo wait, it isn't light headbutt? this game sucks

[1:33:34] <thirddegreee> Most hype game at evo? What are y’all thoughts.
[1:33:37] <FalcieGaiah> @rashidoo is std hp that hammer type of move?
[1:33:37] <thelexnard> none of your vskills after dash just gave you meter @VesperArcade
[1:33:41] <jurifightsforcapcom> Or FEEL IT!,
[1:33:42] <thelexnard> is that right?
[1:33:43] <TimeZero1> I've been playing Cammy since season 1 and Lucia made me want to legit learn another character
[1:33:44] <mtlwolf_> that burn kick is -4 on block, but he's not punishing it :/

[1:42:41] <Fedorabattlemaster> Ross has said before he hates sfv
[1:42:43] <michingmallecho> I guess he wants every game to go back to $500 payouts for 1st place again triFeels
[1:42:48] <battleb0rn> im playing Nier for the first time right now. I just got to the machine village.

[1:43:31] <mrtiki504> RD2....baby! HeyGuys
[1:43:31] <Guarddoge> didn't mike ross say that the only game that he thinks is more wack than SFV is Tekken?
[1:43:32] <GaleXylo> Kanzuki bath water would sell for millions on the CFN
[1:43:33] <game_ryan> '
[1:43:33] <death1137> DotA really never would have thought

[1:43:39] <SwoldierBoiTellEM> whos this mike ross guy yall talkin bout? i just know waxl Kappa
[1:43:41] <darc_requiem> Why does everyone care so much about what Mike Ross thinks. I like the guy, but since when has his opinion been gospel? Dude doesn't like SF3 either.
[1:43:56] <rashidoo> oh he doesnt like sf3?
[1:43:57] <rashidoo> respect
[1:43:58] <misterkeebler> does it really matter if one person likes or dislikes? some ppl like 5 and some dont. as long as you can find matches online, you should be satisfied
[1:44:05] <yogsagat> lol
[1:44:07] <Fedorabattlemaster> I enjoy riding mike Ross’s dick

[1:44:26] <darc_requiem> @rashidoo Yeah it came up often on Excellent Adventures
[1:44:30] <yunggrasshopper77> @darc_requiem so he’s not happy about Honda?
[1:44:32] <Gimme_Makoto> @hordyjonezttv That's the mystery
[1:44:35] <hordyjonezttv> O like Kage is Evil Ryu lol
[1:44:35] <glovecold> Honestly mike ross is irrelevant to me
[1:44:41] <rashidoo> nice, he does have some decent taste in FG's :)
[1:44:42] <LaughsWithKnives> i only play aku in unist OpieOP
[1:44:46] <salindy13> Tbh, I only like Mike Ross when he was salty. OpieOP

[1:45:03] <trumyolo> Smash got 200k and match fixing LUL
[1:45:04] <Guarddoge> There is no Mike "Mike Ross" Ross anymore. All that remains is Waxl
[1:45:08] <darc_requiem> @yunggrasshopper77 Who knows, not sure why anyone is concerned about it. He doesn't like the game. Let him be happy with what he does like.
[1:45:19] <dpgimenez> Is she better than Ken?
[1:45:20] <SlimeBeherit> @hordyjonezttv essentially. If they put Q in this offensives heavy game, he would get mauled
[1:45:20] <Tpyro> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSFskv_6X-4 Sharing some lab work. Lucia +1000 stun, corner carry, 1 mix up. Need VT1, 0 meter. Can pull out more damage if you optimised.
[1:45:21] <nickmeistersa> metro city police are corrupt
[1:45:24] <akaJoness> Vesper you got enough CAWFEE with you to survive the jungle online Kappa
[1:45:26] <icemanblues> her CA animations are bunk. The final kick rotates the wrong way
[1:45:27] <AdmiralAckbars_Snackbar> @VesperArcade how do you get the vskill after you went ex shoulder and then the tatsu move? i can never connect it
[1:45:35] <petipas1414> her accent is an amalgamation of the new york and boston ones
[1:45:36] <max_do_em> you suck ding dong if you talk about mike ross :)
[1:45:40] <salindy13> @Guarddoge Isn't Waxl that GG player though? What has he got to do with this conversation? Kappa

[1:45:48] <CountMeowingtonn> @VesperArcade buy her summer costume Kreygasm
[1:45:52] <michingmallecho> I feel like a lot of SF players hate the sequels when they can’t do the same things they did in the previous games
[1:45:52] <glovecold> At least SFV doesn’t have auto combos
[1:45:53] <SlimeBeherit> @hordyjonezttv so making a more offense type version of him was the only way it was gonna happen
[1:45:56] <thecheeze09> she a yank
[1:46:09] <AdmiralAckbars_Snackbar> yeah

[1:47:19] <hennesyhufflepuf> @VesperArcade now quit being entitled Kappa
[1:47:23] <HelixSoulX> Everyone in this game has better versions of q's moveset, there's no room for him
[1:47:25] <iheartmota> after capcom cup will be balance changes
[1:47:27] <StrongestWoman> LOL .. this Mikas name
[1:47:30] <akaJoness> this match up must be a myth ... mika don't care about tools
[1:47:33] <nacl_warrior> They were thinking bout that cash monayyyy
[1:47:37] <CountMeowingtonn> she gets a cowboy hat it's awesome
[1:47:42] <SlimeBeherit> @VesperArcade Capcom common sense
[1:47:45] <stinkydinky> she was generic in final fight too, its weird they added her
[1:47:45] <glovecold> They moved the main fighting division team over to sf6.
[1:47:51] <hordyjonezttv> Sean please?? I’m tryna throw a basketball at somebody head
[1:47:57] <thecheeze09> I would like guy in there
[1:47:57] <CountMeowingtonn> anyone know the trick to stance canceling as poison?
[1:47:58] <LaLiLuLeLolz> ugh, that whole cashcom meme is so dumb
[1:48:01] <hennesyhufflepuf> @glovecold I would say probably Monster Hunter
[1:48:05] <hennesyhufflepuf> or Teppen
[1:48:05] <Miker1234> @stinkydinky generic there, here they did a good job
[1:48:06] <iheartmota> isn't the mhw main dev the head of the FG division now?
[1:48:17] <yogsagat> Sean trained by El Fuerte.
[1:48:23] <someguy_zero> Suplex City
[1:48:27] <khalz1998> @hordyjonezttv if sean comes in SF5 it better be 2nd impact/New gen gen not turd strike dan edition Kappa
[1:48:35] <duck_helmet> Pretty sure you said Lucia was butt cheese on Wednesday.
[1:48:38] <agsantana> @VesperArcade that was the most beautiful accidental shimmy I've ever seen
[1:48:42] <ninjavanish> I AM THE LAW!
[1:48:42] <Origami22k> "respect the lore" LUL
[1:48:46] <TattooAssassins> What a crappy looking super
[1:48:56] <glovecold> @hennesyhufflepuf Monster hunter lead moved over to fighting game division. Capcom knows it’s important to be first big fighting game for next gen console
[1:48:57] <yogsagat> @khalz1998 I can't wait to see broken ass Sean
[1:48:58] <LaLiLuLeLolz> a lot of supers in this game are basic
[1:49:00] <StrongestWoman> Her super is literally a FF3 rip
[1:49:01] <khalz1998> Godlike looking super Kappa Kappa Kappa
[1:49:02] <icemanblues> the final kick rotates the wrong way
[1:49:04] <byrondadontv> Lucia hits harder than Urien ?
[1:49:09] <misterkeebler> @stinkydinky probably just really wanted this fighting style in the game and didn't have any other ideas lol
[1:49:09] <hordyjonezttv> @khalz1998 facts
[1:49:09] <ustinodj> vesper is a final fight expert now
[1:49:11] <icemanblues> its like Falke's super.. Bonk
[1:49:14] <agsantana> so Ken is actually male Lucia?
[1:49:21] <CountMeowingtonn> when is this corrupt cop going down? she's just beating up random people for no reason BibleThump
[1:49:22] <JJJLeonG> me thinks lucia's ken's long lost sister and kolin's arch enemy
[1:49:24] <LaLiLuLeLolz> or gief's super, literally a german suplex
[1:49:25] <ifernoian> that mp is like cammy haha
[1:49:25] <michel0dy> Ken stole Lucia's super
[1:49:25] <jurifightsforcapcom> Yes ag

[1:49:48] <khalz1998> V skill basketball Mixups

[1:49:55] <LaLiLuLeLolz> Hold that people who act like they played Sean
[1:49:55] <yogsagat> Lucian needs a Morgan costume
[1:49:56] <hordyjonezttv> Eddy gurrrero of Sfv
[1:49:58] <HelixSoulX> 2nd impact sean might be okay, 3rd strike sean is a serious contender for worst frame data of any sf character
[1:49:59] <thecheeze09> If capcom is smart, they better release a FG with everything in tact, no controversy, all polished up and it will sell well
[1:50:00] <jurifightsforcapcom> No @ifernoian commiserate his your chest she hits ya chin xd
[1:50:05] <JJJLeonG> @VesperArcade is Honda's damage extremely explosive? Looked a little unbalanced....
[1:50:10] <mrtiki504> crap ass game SeemsGood
[1:50:11] <9mmSpliff> it can be her super for FF, but doesnt make it good.
[1:50:16] <salindy13> @Miker1234 He went on wikipedia Kappa
[1:50:16] <hennesyhufflepuf> @glovecold he didn't move, he took it over lol. And right now Capcom priority is Iceborne. so don't be surprised if he poached most of the talent for that

[1:50:52] <LaLiLuLeLolz> nah lucia was playable in ff3
[1:50:53] <HelixSoulX> sean had heavys that were punishable on hit by super

[1:50:57] <CountMeowingtonn> you guys see that anime fighter shit poison can do on twitter?
[1:50:57] <SneakyPuppet> bussssass
[1:51:01] <hordyjonezttv> @helixsoulx Yea facts
[1:51:02] <MikeRoss4ever> Lucia looks fun, you can play her different ways
[1:51:07] <TheWholeShoe> @VesperArcade I am Dr. Strange and you are the Ancient One. "Teach Me" ....
[1:51:08] <yogsagat> Ok night guys.
[1:51:09] <LaLiLuLeLolz> Yea, sean's trash and should never come back
[1:51:14] <JJJLeonG> Honda's damage output looks way~~~~ too high
[1:51:14] <cowlikesapricot> I wonder if that guy has a fedora
[1:51:15] <ifernoian> karin is a thot ? that name lol
[1:51:21] <DeviantSuicune> later yogsagat
[1:51:22] <Miker1234> @yogsagat bye man KonCha
[1:51:24] <hordyjonezttv> @lalilulelolz You’re crazy
[1:51:26] <dork_rex> yo did they do any balancing in this update
[1:51:30] <hennesyhufflepuf> later Yogs
[1:51:31] <muenshter> no
[1:51:35] <glovecold> @hennesyhufflepuf Yeah moved and take over is the same thing. What’s important is that Ono has been demoted big time. Sf6 should be special now with a proper budget
[1:51:35] <muenshter> this was not a balance patch
[1:51:36] <dork_rex> ugh
[1:51:38] <LaLiLuLeLolz> the dude threw basketballs ffs
[1:51:41] <hordyjonezttv> @lalilulelolz Sean was not trash
[1:51:42] <LaLiLuLeLolz> that character was butt
[1:51:43] <Blooagentx> @jjjleong he got no range on his normals though
[1:51:51] <stinkydinky> that was just his taunt lol
[1:51:52] <ChefsThatLift_> damn chat moving so fast no one saw my question
[1:51:55] <darc_requiem> @LaLiLuLeLolz Sean was in three games. He was only trash in one of them. He was literally broken in Second Impact
[1:52:01] <mtlwolf_> dont expect balance changes when capcom cup didnt happen yet
[1:52:02] <muenshter> it's apparently too soon before capcom cup
[1:52:05] <icemanblues> She does have a great suplex
[1:52:05] <LaLiLuLeLolz> 3 games? or 3 versions of the same game?
[1:52:19] <Miker1234> @chefsthatlift_ because nobody wants you to suffer Kappa try Honda maybe
[1:52:21] <RobDoka> Hi, what is the best lucia's dp as aa?
[1:52:24] <stinkydinky> not bad
[1:52:25] <hennesyhufflepuf> @glovecold SFV had a budget. most of it probably came from Sony tho
[1:52:28] <hordyjonezttv> @darc_requiem Exactly
[1:52:29] <ifernoian> is lucia's medium tatsu best for anti air?
[1:52:29] <LaLiLuLeLolz> that's like saying Laura's in sfv and SFV ae
[1:52:32] <glovecold> Plus their financial reports show there’s a big title hitting 2021. Maybe RE3 Remake or a fighting game.
[1:52:45] <khalz1998> November and December ono said for new announcemenrs. garanteeed DEC will be SUPER SFV to start of S5
[1:52:47] <DeviantSuicune> @ChefsThatLift_ geif is a struggle to play, but play who you want
[1:52:56] <AdmiralAckbars_Snackbar> waste of meter
[1:52:59] <CountMeowingtonn> @glovecold the guy who made sf4 as a love letter to the fgc being demoted is a good thing 4Head Monster hunter people will surely treat SF with the same love as ono 4Head
[1:53:01] <icemanblues> is her ex tatsu an invisible reversible?
[1:53:03] <ChefsThatLift_> is mika better than gief
[1:53:04] <darc_requiem> @LaLiLuLeLolz Yeah the 90s isn't now. You didn't get balance updates for free. You had buy the games.
[1:53:10] <HelixSoulX> Sean was top 5 in second impact and got nerfed to bottom t
[1:53:11] <DASH_1985> You gotta stop that those run gimmicks
[1:53:19] <Blooagentx> that match were trashbox got stomped by a gief player was amazing
[1:53:24] <jurifightsforcapcom> Thank god, light spd gets no pressure after...
[1:53:25] <brosencephalon> maybe they will increase input delay to make online better Kappa
[1:53:27] <LaLiLuLeLolz> and we all know what a pillar of the fgc 2nd impact was Kappa
[1:53:27] <glovecold> @hennesyhufflepuf Yeah but Sony only spend up the development. Without Sony’s money it would’ve been released in 2018.
[1:53:28] <Blooagentx> *where
[1:53:31] <FunkMound> laggy af
[1:53:39] <HelixSoulX> tier in third strike

[1:53:45] <DeviantSuicune> f
[1:53:50] <hennesyhufflepuf> @glovecold that's business
[1:53:53] <CountMeowingtonn> sony is just going to buy the rights to SF and be ingrained in the fgc forever Kappa
[1:53:54] <xFEELINGGODLIKEx> good ass street fighter
[1:53:59] <Miker1234> ok Cawffee boys need to work tomorrow

[1:54:11] <darc_requiem> @LaLiLuLeLolz And we all know these numerous SF3 fans were non existent when people like were actually pumping quarters into arcade machines.

[1:54:32] <ninjavanish> Night @Miker1234
[1:54:33] <werdna2590gmail> Is vt1 DP incredible
[1:54:33] <ChefsThatLift_> @vesperarcade is mika better than gief ? who should i play
[1:54:34] <cd3performance> What up Vesper
[1:54:34] <darc_requiem> Some of us actually played SF3 before Daigo parried Justin. Just sayin
[1:54:36] <hennesyhufflepuf> night Miker
[1:54:37] <LaLiLuLeLolz> sf3 is the number one fighting game everybody likes to act like they played at the time
[1:54:40] <khalz1998> so was the METAL GEAR tease a big joke then or sometuing?
[1:54:46] <hordyjonezttv> Sean or necro would make this game hype again
[1:54:47] <YujiSenpai> i like her tho
[1:54:48] <michingmallecho> Ultra SF5 with PS5 on launch day. It comes with a beta code for SF6. capcomSagat capcomSagat capcomSagat
[1:54:48] <megatonbeef> @khalz1998 Yes
[1:54:50] <hennesyhufflepuf> a big joke on EVO's part
[1:54:52] <jimmylee1015> Hopefully? <.<
[1:54:53] <DeviantSuicune> the mirror
[1:54:59] <ifernoian> DAN for sv5 will be hype
[1:55:04] <glovecold> @countmeowingtonn It’s not Ono’s fault Capcom was struggling for years. They gave him a weak budget
[1:55:08] <akinohamlet> 1.4k viewers PogChamp
[1:55:12] <hordyjonezttv> Or violent ken
[1:55:25] <InfectedJazz> Horde Lucia
[1:55:26] <michingmallecho> I blame Inafune for messing with a Capcom during those years
[1:55:29] <Rugalitarian> ronald mcdonald lucia
[1:55:30] <DeviantSuicune> double cawfee
[1:55:33] <ifernoian> or goutestu gouken's master
[1:55:34] <jurifightsforcapcom> I thought ono was SFv’s hype man
[1:55:39] <hennesyhufflepuf> Inafune fucked a lot of stuff up
[1:55:40] <val_kryel> The tackle isn't -6?
[1:55:41] <AtlasNYC> I hate playing people who pick this stage
[1:55:43] <NaughtyJuri> I like her voice
[1:56:06] <TheWholeShoe> How are people smurfing? I tried to play Lucia on my alt steam account but the "Free Trial" is overwriting my family share privileges T_T
[1:56:09] <StrongestWoman> the tackle is -6, but you can space it out to be -2 (I think -1 at MAX range)
[1:56:15] <khalz1998> as much as people hate on ono. if it wasnt for Ono we wouldnt have even got SF4.
[1:56:16] <HelixSoulX> Necro changed the least from second
[1:56:18] <jurifightsforcapcom> @atlasnyc sorry but I love this stage
[1:56:20] <CountMeowingtonn> @glovecold you dead ass said with Ono no longer in charge sf6 will be better because of it
[1:56:21] <Moobot> Join the Vesper Arcade Discord at https://discord.gg/esjX5km
[1:56:32] <LaLiLuLeLolz> hating on ono is a bandwagon thing
[1:56:33] <b1gam3r> that's cool you can kick the fireball with another special
[1:56:34] <YujiSenpai> yes space its -2 at best
[1:56:35] <glovecold> @michingmallecho And the insane budget on RE6 had put Capcom in a deep hole.
[1:56:35] <CountMeowingtonn> dont' defend him lmao
[1:56:37] <darc_requiem> @LaLiLuLeLolz I know this. It why I can laugh at history repeating itself fam. People bitched about all the new characters in SF3. Fast forward to SFIV and they wanted them all back. I was one of two people that played Alex in my local arcade. It's funny seeing him be "so popular" in the character requests.
[1:56:38] <LaLiLuLeLolz> kinda like liking 3rd strike
[1:56:41] <ifernoian> can you combo anything after 2 crouching light jabs?
[1:56:49] <hennesyhufflepuf> MH guy is the more than likely the reason S4 has been so wack
[1:56:51] <StrongestWoman> her v skill
[1:56:57] <hennesyhufflepuf> he's calling the shots now
[1:56:58] <thelexnard> or medium DP
[1:57:04] <YujiSenpai> vskill or maybe tatsu
[1:57:08] <hordyjonezttv> Yea this stage lit @darc_requiem exactly
[1:57:12] <CountMeowingtonn> If ono was still in charge we'd have balance changes Kappa
[1:57:17] <LaLiLuLeLolz> ugh alex
[1:57:19] <DASH_1985> She can also combo off of 2 standing lights
[1:57:25] <ifernoian> would be funny if you could kick the opponent lucia's fireball too
[1:57:27] <LaLiLuLeLolz> another character everybody claims to have wanted, yet nobody plays
[1:57:31] <mrtiki504> OhMyDog
[1:57:35] <FunkMound> a lot of offensive v-skills, meanwhile, I'm all warmed up.
[1:57:44] <megatonbeef> All warmed up
[1:57:45] <jurifightsforcapcom> this char is weird to me, has a lot of stuff that don’t seem to go together, like Ed
[1:57:50] <khalz1998> @lalilulelolz thats like every fg lol
[1:57:53] <LaLiLuLeLolz> nobody even played alex in sf3
[1:57:55] <Rugalitarian> the only people who wanted poison are people who post youtube comments
[1:57:58] <glovecold> @countmeowingtonn Yeah he won’t be the lead anymore because obviously Capcom wouldn’t give him a proper budget. Monster hunter guy will get a much better budget because Capcom trust his team and his directing abilities
[1:57:58] <HelixSoulX> Alex has somehow maintained his tier from new generation to sfv
[1:58:11] <darc_requiem> Lucia has been pretty damned funny. All these people complained about here. I get on Twitch and she's getting played more than Honda or Poison LUL
[1:58:11] <LaLiLuLeLolz> I definitely believe poison's more popular than alex
[1:58:11] <hordyjonezttv> @lalilulelolz who do you think they should add then?
[1:58:15] <JJJLeonG> -8 on vskill??????
[1:58:18] <FunkMound> I like how Honda kept his identity.
[1:58:19] <hennesyhufflepuf> Capcom trusts him to make money
[1:58:19] <ventolin620> @jurifightsforcapcom like what?
[1:58:21] <hennesyhufflepuf> let's be real
[1:58:23] <cowlikesapricot> In VT it's -8 too?
[1:58:25] <FunkMound> Meanwhile Alex is a potato.
[1:58:29] <LaLiLuLeLolz> Me personally?
[1:58:30] <Rugalitarian> The game didnt need more fucking characters. It needed fixing
[1:58:30] <khalz1998> isnt alex alot better in V compared to SF3. even urien imo plays better and i dont even plau urien
[1:58:36] <glovecold> Yes. It’s all about profitability
[1:58:38] <LaLiLuLeLolz> Viper, maybe Makoto
[1:58:48] <hordyjonezttv> Lucia is popular because if that catchy theme
[1:58:48] <thecheeze09> karin and urien were like the only characters people wanted from the previous game that are viable. Alex was a fail
[1:58:55] <lordshiiva> honest what doesn't Lucia have?
[1:58:56] <hordyjonezttv> Of that*
[1:58:57] <FunkMound> Alex 3S was just cooler.
[1:58:59] <megatonbeef> @khalz1998 Cause all his slow moves where huge parry bait
[1:59:04] <hennesyhufflepuf> us not getting any news for 8 months was also him
[1:59:05] <ifernoian> vesper ~ are you able to kick the opponent's lucia fireball back? the one that looks like its going up.
[1:59:09] <darc_requiem> Unfortunately Alex was never good. He was fun as hell to play though.
[1:59:16] <Child_af_God> is this Ken's sister or something?
[1:59:19] <hordyjonezttv> And she’s clean
[1:59:21] <ventolin620> @lordshiiva a parry Kappa
[1:59:23] <YujiSenpai> no
[1:59:24] <ifernoian> try in training mode XD
[1:59:28] <cyberimmersion> @lordshiiva patience with criminals
[1:59:32] <SneakyPuppet> salami time ⌚
[1:59:32] <someguy_zero> Why'd you change the color? PepeHands
[1:59:33] <lordshiiva> lmao
[1:59:33] <pollosucio_> how is street fighter sonya?
[1:59:34] <glovecold> 8 months of silence was pretty bad. I thought they dropped the game lol.
[1:59:35] <DeviantSuicune> lol
[1:59:39] <lordshiiva> I'ma buy her later
[1:59:45] <thelexnard> sounds like a funny mini game...if SFV had cool stuff like that
[1:59:47] <FunkMound> At least we have MH:W
[1:59:49] <jurifightsforcapcom> Hmm menat reflecting high fireball
[1:59:50] <lordshiiva> I'm trying to learn kolin rn
[1:59:51] <hennesyhufflepuf> his priority ain't this game.
[2:00:00] <CountMeowingtonn> @glovecold lmao you think he's just gonna give the division 2 team money that division 1 made? with Ono there'd probably be a balance patch right now
[2:00:12] <HelixSoulX> Urien had all 5-5s in third strike, he was strong but never really bullied any other character
[2:00:17] <ifernoian> ED
[2:00:17] <jurifightsforcapcom> Dash doesn’t have a priority xd
[2:00:20] <ifernoian> lol
[2:00:21] <Butchmel> Can the fireball cross up
[2:00:22] <DeviantSuicune> ed boi

[2:00:41] <cowlikesapricot> It wasn't 8 month of silence. Just no characters. There were stages and costumes. They shouldn't have waited to release the character though.
[2:00:42] <hordyjonezttv> In this gsmet
[2:00:46] <khalz1998> @ifernoian hes alreasy done a Honda one lol

[2:01:05] <hordyjonezttv> Yea his Nero costume lit tho
[2:01:08] <CountMeowingtonn> haHAA they released costumes that makes up for no information about the actual game
[2:01:10] <glovecold> @countmeowingtonn Yes. You make large profits in one division to only expand and improve on the other divisions. That’s how DMCV was funded.
[2:01:16] <hennesyhufflepuf> @cowlikesapricot ok 8 months without anything meaningful
[2:01:20] <JettJett2> I think Ono was desperate to recreate another epic reveal like last year's Evo drop of Sagat and G
[2:01:25] <SlimeBeherit> LaggEd
[2:01:26] <StrongestWoman> Ed and Laura are instant rollback
[2:01:30] <hordyjonezttv> This guy Ed is ass tho

[2:03:58] <ayv__> follows
[2:04:00] <SneakyPuppet> 💰
[2:04:02] <darc_requiem> His connection needed some damn coffee
[2:04:06] <khalz1998> in the end...street fighter always stays alive NRs games die off quickly. anime games also. lets be honest DBZ is good but if marvel didnt fuck up it would be dead.
[2:04:08] <hordyjonezttv> Ed Is The Goat
[2:04:10] <oldschoolReflexes> if the run side charge is blocked, is it safe or minus?
[2:04:13] <gatoconbotas> Lucia clon character LUL
[2:04:13] <RockmanX74> Yo Vesper! Whats good bro?
[2:04:15] <xiaowa562> LUL
[2:04:17] <glovecold> Nrs sell movie games.
[2:04:25] <YujiSenpai> yes cause it online
[2:04:27] <YujiSenpai> LUL
[2:04:30] <hennesyhufflepuf> and they make tons of money for it
[2:04:33] <akaJoness> it is -1 and you would be surprised
[2:04:37] <SneakyPuppet> 🤣
[2:04:38] <DeviantSuicune> offline that shouldn't work
[2:04:40] <akaJoness> -1 on block
[2:04:43] <hennesyhufflepuf> a fighting game is the best selling game of the year so far
[2:04:44] <enzo152> oh jones playing lucia too
[2:04:46] <I_nod_my_head_when_I_lose> +11 online
[2:04:47] <xFEELINGGODLIKEx> LUL
[2:04:47] <DeviantSuicune> but its online so fuck it
[2:04:48] <jurifightsforcapcom> Dbfz has more clone chars then sf2 and umkc3 combined
[2:04:52] <nacl_warrior> From a scrubs perspective
[2:04:54] <michingmallecho> That DBFZ payout for GO1 is embrassing triFeels
[2:04:59] <LaLiLuLeLolz> making more money doesn't mean your product is better
[2:05:05] <akaJoness> noooo I am not online vega
[2:05:06] <TheJunesPrince> How plus is the shoulder if you hit meaty? @akaJoness
[2:05:07] <hordyjonezttv> @jurifightsforcapcom But fighters is more exciting
[2:05:15] <TheJunesPrince> On hit
[2:05:15] <StevenAitsover> StevenAitsover subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 5 month streak! 
[2:05:19] <akaJoness> +8 @TheJunesPrince
[2:05:20] <hennesyhufflepuf> @LaLiLuLeLolz usually you make more depending on the quality
[2:05:21] <AlmiranteCami> change costume
[2:05:23] <hordyjonezttv> Dbfz is better than this game
[2:05:24] <Mecha_G> four Gokus and three Vegetas
[2:05:28] <omari1998> fighterz is a snoozefest
[2:05:28] <LaLiLuLeLolz> Not at all
[2:05:29] <hordyjonezttv> Let’s argue
[2:05:39] <Llesor> let's not
[2:05:40] <michingmallecho> Then go watch a DBFZ stream🤔
[2:05:43] <ventolin620> @thejunesprince plus 5 i think
[2:05:44] <LaLiLuLeLolz> A lot goes into that. NRS has WAY more money to actually advertise and promote their game than SF does
[2:05:44] <YujiSenpai> uh rog is kinda rough
[2:05:45] <hordyjonezttv> Y’all trippin
[2:05:45] <lordshiiva> I see we got cappers in chat hggOkay hggOkay hggOkay hggOkay hggOkay
[2:05:46] <LaLiLuLeLolz> For example
[2:05:50] <khalz1998> @hordyjonezttv two different type of fighting games. they both GOOD
[2:05:51] <Vampirekoala1> plz
[2:05:52] <hennesyhufflepuf> @LaLiLuLeLolz explain Tekken then
[2:05:54] <hordyjonezttv> I like sfv too tho
[2:05:56] <hennesyhufflepuf> or DBZ
[2:05:56] <CountMeowingtonn> @hordyjonezttv no
[2:05:58] <jurifightsforcapcom> Argue all you want but if you want to fight log into sfv
[2:06:04] <akaJoness> LUL that emote @lordshiiva
[2:06:04] <darc_requiem> @LaLiLuLeLolz Yeah they have that WB bankroll backing them up
[2:06:07] <jurifightsforcapcom> Or join vesperarcade lobby later
[2:06:10] <LaLiLuLeLolz> DBZ? Umm the fact that it's Dragon Ball?
[2:06:11] <NaughtyJuri> @jurifightsforcapcom LOL
[2:06:14] <LaLiLuLeLolz> You don't think that helped a little?
[2:06:21] <khalz1998> @lalilulelolz exactly
[2:06:23] <MadTheMerc88> @vesperarcade or chat would you recommend Honda for getting back into sfv???
[2:06:29] <hennesyhufflepuf> And SF ain;t got name recognition?
[2:06:31] <AdmiralAckbars_Snackbar> all that money doesnt save nrs games tournamnet wise
[2:06:35] <bounty_skull> we can all settle this win a game of SF
[2:06:38] <AdmiralAckbars_Snackbar> they legitimatly had the worst top 8
[2:06:44] <LaLiLuLeLolz> You're crazy if you think SF has half the name recognition that dragon ball has
[2:06:47] <AdmiralAckbars_Snackbar> and zheir entry numbers are falling
[2:06:50] <NaughtyJuri> @la lil full oz I see you Stoner Kappa
[2:06:51] <thatonegy99> @hennesyhufflepuf dragon ball easily surpasses sf in recognition
[2:06:53] <michingmallecho> Use Ryu as your gateway character first
[2:06:55] <hennesyhufflepuf> @LaLiLuLeLolz explain Tekken then
[2:06:58] <hordyjonezttv> @lalilulelolz Facts
[2:07:00] <NinoDiablo> Damn she's got some kicks
[2:07:03] <ustinodj> anyone wanna do lobbies
[2:07:04] <LaLiLuLeLolz> I can't explain that one
[2:07:04] <Vin_Wind> evo has pretty good this year especially the snake cameo
[2:07:14] <LaLiLuLeLolz> I literally don't know what people see in Tekken, but I'm not hating on it
[2:07:18] <ventolin620> @madthemerc88 they made hhs even easier so yeah
[2:07:19] <AdmiralAckbars_Snackbar> tekken is a game even dudebros that only play cod play
[2:07:22] <hordyjonezttv> DBZ Is More popular than sf
[2:07:22] <LaLiLuLeLolz> Graphics maybe?
[2:07:23] <StrongestWoman> the snake cameo literally got Snake himself heated lol
[2:07:25] <hennesyhufflepuf> they see a good product
[2:07:27] <hordyjonezttv> No debate
[2:07:28] <CountMeowingtonn> my favorite part about the snake cameo was the voice of snake being really mad about it
[2:07:29] <megatonbeef> @admiralackbars_snackbar Akuma
[2:07:32] <SneakyPuppet> 💰
[2:07:34] <michingmallecho> EVO had a bunch of technical issues. Infexious winning capcomSagat capcomSagat capcomSagat
[2:07:34] <hennesyhufflepuf> which is why it sells
[2:07:47] <hennesyhufflepuf> Not only that SF had a rocky launch
[2:07:48] <TruVietTL510> Lucia is sick!!
[2:07:49] <someguy_zero> Kreygasm
[2:07:50] <khalz1998> TEKKEN is a great game + 100bonus for AKUMA + GEESE we got CAPCOM vs SNK 3
[2:07:52] <ScurvyErm> tekken 7 is fun as hell is why
[2:07:55] <hennesyhufflepuf> took a while to get decent
[2:07:55] <LaLiLuLeLolz> Just cuz something's a quality product doesn't mean it will sell
[2:07:56] <omari1998> SF made over 10 billion in revenue. can dragonball games touch that?
[2:07:56] <MadTheMerc88> @ventolin620 aprit
[2:07:58] <LaughsWithKnives> LaLiLuLeLolz explosive neutral
[2:07:58] <Efonzerellie> when's Warlord?
[2:08:04] <NaughtyJuri> Besides the sub only mode and stupid EVO snake joke it was a good evo
[2:08:06] <MadTheMerc88> Appreciate it i mean lol
[2:08:09] <bounty_skull> street fighter is way more better than DBZ OVERALL
[2:08:13] <yunggrasshopper77> Good stuff @vesperarcade
[2:08:22] <FlashyFlash> if bonchan saw the screen he would be wtf ashlolNotLikeThis
[2:08:26] <StrongestWoman> DBZ is like.. one of the highest selling markets of all time.. lol
[2:08:29] <LaLiLuLeLolz> street fighter and dbz are like apples and oranges
[2:08:31] <StrongestWoman> Pokemon is #1 though
[2:08:32] <LaLiLuLeLolz> can't compare them
[2:08:38] <LaLiLuLeLolz> DBZ is filling marvel's void right now
[2:08:41] <bounty_skull> true
[2:08:42] <CountMeowingtonn> @VesperArcade evo was obviously a rigged event gone wrong
[2:08:46] <GrandMasterMingLee> yeah
[2:08:46] <newyorkpizza_> Lucia Capcom Sonya
[2:08:48] <khalz1998> TK3, TK5 AND TK7 best tekken games the rest are meh imo. Bringing 2D mechanics/characters into T7 made game 10x more hype
[2:08:50] <hennesyhufflepuf> You still on DBZ, what about Tekken @VesperArcade
[2:08:56] <Vin_Wind> i expect evo 2020 to have the same lineup except replace unist with guilty gear
[2:08:58] <hordyjonezttv> Yea I like both
[2:09:02] <hennesyhufflepuf> it ain't got DBZ's name
[2:09:03] <I_nod_my_head_when_I_lose> I miss chill town, updates bring out the degenerates lnrRee
[2:09:09] <hennesyhufflepuf> yet it still did well
[2:09:15] <AdmiralAckbars_Snackbar> @Vin_Wind expecting gg to be out before evo 020
[2:09:17] <LaLiLuLeLolz> I have nothing against Tekken, I just don't enjoy it on any level
[2:09:18] <akaJoness> come on vesper balrog dash is reactable Kappa
[2:09:30] <rfhc5> Everybody lags but Vesper Kappa
[2:09:33] <King_Wiley_> Roll back is so much better than delay netcode Kappa
[2:09:37] <garlandu> degenerate deez nutz

[2:09:45] <someguy_zero> REKT

[2:10:33] <LaLiLuLeLolz> That just feels gimmicky
[2:10:43] <hordyjonezttv> Guilty Gear???
[2:10:49] <CountMeowingtonn> KIRYU WILL MAKE IT INTO TEKKEN ONE DAY
[2:10:50] <AdmiralAckbars_Snackbar> kof wont be there in 2020
[2:10:50] <hordyjonezttv> Or nah
[2:10:50] <YujiSenpai> wait haomaru in SC is OD tho
[2:10:52] <LaLiLuLeLolz> And it sucks when a guest character gets into the game when your actual main isn't there
[2:11:06] <StrongestWoman> the only guest character Street Fighter needs.. isnt even fully a guest character.. When is Ryu Ranger? PogChamp
[2:11:07] <redpotato> is lucia run safe?

[2:12:00] <thatonegy99> @wildaccusations no way 2d sprites are way to expensive for poor as SNK
[2:12:05] <umaRFTW> was that a frame trap? run into shoulder?
[2:12:06] <hennesyhufflepuf> 2D art is expensive

[2:13:04] <michingmallecho> KOF is probably going to be like Samsho. Without the Ink and other special samurai effects
[2:13:08] <WildAccusations> @AdmiralAckbars_Snackbar @thatonegy99 That dead eye mobile phone art style needs to go. Worst than MvCI

[2:15:51] <muenshter> Vegito duffed him to make him stop

[2:16:56] <8PoOryGone8> they need dead Goku with halo Kappa
[2:16:58] <foxide_> the amount of gokus in
[2:16:59] <KingFossilFER> whos gongeta? didnt they annouce goku blue?
[2:17:00] <CountMeowingtonn> gogeta is the one with more of goku's personality so i guess he's goku Kappa
[2:17:03] <someguy_zero> Blond Akuma REEE

[2:17:05] <GrandMasterMingLee> any saiyan is goku
[2:17:07] <Bunky0696> Well gogeta is a fusion
[2:17:08] <LaLiLuLeLolz> Base Super Buu and Kid Buu are probably close to even
[2:17:08] <DacJosh> But he will not be the same gameplay wise
[2:17:09] <CaptScrumptious> "not bad"
[2:17:11] <WildAccusations> Jenemba is the first character to have me hype since the game released

[2:29:26] <YujiSenpai> we he show vesper the gap tho
[2:29:31] <YujiSenpai> thats the question
[2:29:34] <LaLiLuLeLolz> Pretty much
[2:29:36] <SneakyPuppet> this. punk on my screen 🤣😂
[2:29:36] <luvmastahchris> Is nash any good?
[2:29:38] <ustinodj> anyone wanna do lobbies
[2:29:42] <thatonegy99> @jurifightsforcapcom and its still not good enough lol
[2:29:43] <ninjavanish> LUL
[2:29:44] <ifernoian> hes good. when bonchan uses it
[2:29:47] <tiago_lucena> her fireball looks soooo slow
[2:29:50] <LaLiLuLeLolz> Am I the only one who misses Ibuki VT1 shenannigans?
[2:29:51] <muenshter> pfff
[2:30:08] <DangalfTheKrey> nash doesn't exist at high tournament level LUL
[2:30:09] <jurifightsforcapcom> Lol that’s not fair xd, that’s why I’m glad Juri’s fireball hits low
[2:30:11] <captainfirefeet> the GAP
[2:30:12] <michingmallecho> VT2 triGiggle
[2:30:13] <YujiSenpai> LUL
[2:30:21] <LaLiLuLeLolz> ...juri's fireball def doesn't hit low
[2:30:23] <NB_HusTLa23> I see nerfs happening real quick on lucia
[2:30:26] <NecroSeth> @LaLiLuLeLolz yes. but I wish every character had viable vt1s and 2s
[2:30:27] <LaLiLuLeLolz> I WISH it did
[2:30:28] <gruff_gridof> doodFps
[2:30:30] <jurifightsforcapcom> Now if only capcom made it so sweep doesn’t beat it like WTF cmonBruh
[2:30:33] <khalz1998> whos juri? LUL Kappa
[2:30:44] <jurifightsforcapcom> by hit low I mean low trajectory xd
[2:30:47] <LaLiLuLeLolz> my main BibleThump
[2:30:49] <SneakyPuppet> vtc 😔
[2:30:56] <ifernoian> imagine ryu vt2 was 1 frame startup
[2:31:00] <luvmastahchris> I wish they’d buff Nash at least
[2:31:02] <hordyjonezttv> Word Juri’s old news now
[2:31:08] <tiago_lucena> i like how the background poster changes when the fight is over
[2:31:08] <HelixSoulX> Nash has 2 not viable triggers
[2:31:14] <akaJoness> one day there will be a real angry nash player on reddit (probably just before season 5)
[2:31:14] <michingmallecho> Who’s juri?
[2:31:30] <LaLiLuLeLolz> Alls I want for Juri is for not to be able to be thrown out of moves where she's clearly airborne, and maybe give her at least a few plus frames somewhere
[2:31:32] <NaughtyJuri> @khalz1998 a character from USF4 feelsadman
[2:31:38] <YesSir00> nashs theme is low key a banger
[2:31:39] <khalz1998> was juri even played alot in SSF4/USF4
[2:31:40] <LaLiLuLeLolz> I think Juri has the least amount of plus frames in the entire game
[2:31:42] <8PoOryGone8> there are nash players?!
[2:31:45] <YujiSenpai> lucia fireball is actually good
[2:31:45] <ifernoian> are there any stage KO's like falling into bath water for this stage?
[2:31:58] <muenshter> no stage kos
[2:32:04] <ifernoian> dam that would be cool
[2:32:05] <cjGRAYSON> is vesper the best lucia rn ?
[2:32:05] <tiago_lucena> @ifernoian that would be sick
[2:32:08] <cjGRAYSON> jones
[2:32:10] <8PoOryGone8> capcom got lazy with the stages

[2:32:14] <NecroSeth> Capcom doesn't do stage interactions anymore
[2:32:15] <jurifightsforcapcom> Also give back st MK v trig cancel first hit lol
[2:32:15] <cjGRAYSON> i mean shaquille
[2:32:19] <someguy_zero> Ryu will forever be top tier in Season 1 because you can't have Street Fighter without Ryu FeelsBadMan
[2:32:19] <ifernoian> like the stage where you get noodles on head etc.

[2:57:40] <yunggrasshopper77> @michingmallecho well that’s what you get when you have a currupt Mayor.
[2:57:41] <RagingMarmot> Oni yeah
[2:57:45] <A_Char> It's probably Gill

[2:57:47] <Kantokid123> vesperChair vesperChair
[2:57:47] <VariantX7> Oro's a damn beast
[2:57:47] <EllisWun> Isn't Gill basically a god
[2:57:48] <ifernoian> akuma on crack = oni
[2:57:49] <Abstrakt_Logic> Gill
[2:57:50] <mr__lawyer> oro is stronger than akuma
[2:57:50] <zacksorrowhole> Hi @hashfrags
[2:57:52] <Creid_exe> cody
[2:57:52] <JBMDoolio> versper's BM has evolved into "justified mechanical BM"
[2:57:53] <xdragon2k> it's obviously Dan
[2:57:53] <AdmiralAckbars_Snackbar> lore wise Cody is as strong as shin akuma
[2:57:54] <supah_kydd> oro is the strongest character in Street Fighter history
[2:57:54] <darc_requiem> Oro literally fights people with one hand behind his back
[2:57:56] <akaJoness> gill beat oni and evil ryu at the same time
[2:57:57] <Sandman444a> Cody, Oro, Gill
[2:57:58] <ifernoian> i doubt oro can beat ONI
[2:57:59] <RagingMarmot> Oro is by his own admission
[2:58:00] <Hotsaucenelly237> El Fuerte
[2:58:00] <EroSenpai99> With Poison story mode capcom japan gave up and made him a trans FeelsBadMan
[2:58:01] <I_nod_my_head_when_I_lose> chair chan turned his back on us BibleThump
[2:58:05] <TheMegamansam> Oro is so strong he only uses one arm
[2:58:06] <hashfrags> Hi @zacksorrowhole lirikH
[2:58:07] <corruptedllama003> I’m really boutta getcho pickle chin ahh boi
[2:58:07] <Neoxon> Yeah
[2:58:09] <darc_requiem> Oro has EX Super Arts LUL
[2:58:14] <DonPunchPunk> Evil RyuUSF4
[2:58:15] <ifernoian> can oro beat ONI akuma?
[2:58:18] <jurifightsforcapcom> oro has unblockabke setups and it’s more consistent then aegis
[2:58:21] <CountMeowingtonn> what if cody is in jail in sf4 because lucia falsely arrested him? 🤔
[2:58:21] <Neoxon> Oro & Gill are OP in the lore
[2:58:22] <AdmiralAckbars_Snackbar> @akaJoness wasnt Gil beaten by Urien?
[2:58:24] <jurifightsforcapcom> Let that sink in
[2:58:25] <ronswanson01> 1.dan 2 dan 3 dan 4 dan 5 shin akuma
[2:58:27] <darc_requiem> He's like the only character in SF that can EX his Supers fam
[2:58:27] <Tristar49> Oros super projectile the size of the screen bruh
[2:58:27] <supah_kydd> and Elena is the tallest female Street Fighter character in history
[2:58:28] <highfivepotater> oro can crush oni
[2:58:29] <jerich100> Her head is super small
[2:58:29] <MikeTales> Season 3 Abigail is the correct answer
[2:58:32] <xdragon2k> Oro can defeat anyone one handed.
[2:58:33] <NeoKable_> Shinryu may be the strongest if you go by the comics
[2:58:35] <YoraiDragon> @akaJoness that wasn't cannon
[2:58:35] <megafloraa> Cody is supposed to be super strong but he never puts in his best effort
[2:58:39] <rashidoo> what i do to precisely choose which hundred hands come out is, i press jab twice to start the hundred hand count, then mash the ex hands input
[2:58:41] <RanHibiki > How Gill is the most strong if he got his ass beat?
[2:58:43] <I_nod_my_head_when_I_lose> Think they're talking about lore
[2:58:44] <Sandman444a> Oni aint even canon
[2:58:47] <FlashyFlash> he made that up
[2:58:48] <louiiitoon> sheng long
[2:58:49] <Pondersleuth> In the Lore its Oni Akuma >Shin Akuma > Bision = Oro =healthy Gen = Gill > Goken
[2:58:53] <darc_requiem> Oro actually has a Spirit Bomb
[2:58:54] <jerich100> Small head huge ass, gj capcom
[2:58:56] <YoraiDragon> It was in a comic
[2:58:57] <RagingMarmot> what about Violent Ken
[2:59:00] <YoraiDragon> @VesperArcade
[2:59:04] <zacksorrowhole> a fake one Kappa
[2:59:04] <Pondersleuth> Gill is weak. He got beat by Ken in Second impact.
[2:59:07] <CountMeowingtonn> Cody would rival Oro if he put in effort
[2:59:07] <RagingMarmot> LUL
[2:59:07] <xdragon2k> it's spirit booger
[2:59:11] <Streamo> Whens GILLLLL?
[2:59:13] <ifernoian> goutestu? gouken 's master = ryu's master's master
[2:59:16] <caracancel> @VesperArcade toughts on new GG?
[2:59:20] <itzgirrr> Gill got beat by Ibuki
[2:59:20] <TheMegamansam> Gil is just some rich boy
[2:59:21] <FreedomKME> Gill is just a dude, genetically modified
[2:59:23] <Bunky0696> @rashidoo Thanks ill try that
[2:59:23] <darc_requiem> @xdragon2k You are not wrong LUL
[2:59:24] <JBMDoolio> healthy gen, now that's a variation
[2:59:25] <EllisWun> The mark of my dignity, shall scar thy DNA. lobosDied
[2:59:27] <supah_kydd> @pondersleuth Oro is the strongest hands down Capcom even said that
[2:59:30] <Tristar49> Naw Oro and Akuma r tied. Bison weaker than them
[2:59:30] <JBMDoolio> violent ken, healthy gen
[2:59:35] <Kawaiidin> LUL
[2:59:35] <jurifightsforcapcom> Darc is NOT trolling oro has a spirit bomb
[2:59:37] <Pondersleuth> Oni Akuma is the strongest.
[2:59:37] <YoraiDragon> I hope Jam and Justice is in the new GG
[2:59:38] <LaughsWithKnives> damn
[2:59:38] <wardo62> Is Seth in top 5
[2:59:39] <cowlikesapricot> And add more than 10 frames of animation
[2:59:39] <inkytheslinky> Dumb it down? BibleThump
[2:59:41] <ifernoian> how about gouken's master= goutetsu
[2:59:41] <youlookcute> What about Dan?
[2:59:42] <Tristar49> Gill a beast too
[2:59:43] <CountMeowingtonn> the devs said that previous GG games were too complicated
[2:59:49] <CountMeowingtonn> they actually will lol
[2:59:50] <I_nod_my_head_when_I_lose> How will killey bully people then?
[2:59:57] <EroSenpai99> This stage makes the game so laggy
[2:59:58] <darc_requiem> Goutetsu got killed Akuma
[3:00:00] <ifernoian> dan will one day kill sagat
[3:00:03] <Abstrakt_Logic> genetic? Is that why he resurrects and has seraphic wrath?
[3:00:11] <RanHibiki > I hope there's actual fights in the story mode
[3:00:11] <akaJoness> it happened but I dunno if it is canon or not ...
[3:00:11] <darc_requiem> Akuma got bodied by Gouken but Gouken spared him.
[3:00:13] <wawojr> @VesperArcade How, with the updated netcode? Kappa
[3:00:16] <darc_requiem> Akuma took the run back on Gouken
[3:00:18] <YoraiDragon> @CountMeowingtonn better not be much less difficult than Xrd Rev 2, that actually felt good
[3:00:23] <Guarddoge> Arcsys- "we want the DBZ and ironic weeb crowd"
[3:00:30] <ifernoian> wait till akuma brings friends from tekken~
[3:00:34] <MightySandwich> Cyber Akuma was a fun variant
[3:00:41] <LaughsWithKnives> cyber akuma > all
[3:00:44] <jurifightsforcapcom> Is their a lore that says oro ever lost?
[3:00:52] <wardo62> Gouken
[3:00:56] <yunggrasshopper77> Oro is the only one Akuma respects @vvesperarcade
[3:01:01] <darc_requiem> @jurifightsforcapcom Not to my knowledge
[3:01:02] <TheMegamansam> Robo Zangief
[3:01:03] <ronswanson01> how many games does arc have their hands in
[3:01:08] <YoraiDragon> Canon: Everyone loses to Makoto in PMS Mode KappaHD
[3:01:15] <supah_kydd> @jurifightsforcapcom ya oronever lost a single fight
[3:01:17] <CountMeowingtonn> @VesperArcade the GG devs have said that the previous games were too complicated
[3:01:18] <AdmiralAckbars_Snackbar> akuma respects also gen @yunggrasshopper77
[3:01:18] <akaJoness> LOL when in doubt
[3:01:21] <DontgetBwopped> Oro survived the Raging Demon.
[3:01:26] <wardo62> Gouken / Oni / Oro / Gill / Seth are the strongest characters of all time maybe?
[3:01:27] <A_Char> I think Arcsys made like 4 games in a year or something, kind of ridiculous
[3:01:28] <ifernoian> akuma respects heiachi mishima
[3:01:29] <Tristar49> Akuma calls everyone pathetic except my ninja Oro
[3:01:34] <jurifightsforcapcom> Well oro is the strongest then that settles it
[3:01:35] <Thiir> @VesperArcade after lucia CC u can run shoulder
[3:01:41] <Abstrakt_Logic> @YoraiDragon That's Tandem Renki. Show some respect!

[3:02:16] <Blooagentx> inb4 mass movement back to rev 2
[3:02:18] <RagingMarmot> they ruin Guilty Gear I'm done with anime fighters
[3:02:20] <Vampirekoala1> :(
[3:02:21] <wackotaco13> LUL
[3:02:21] <zacksorrowhole> Game will die fast
[3:02:21] <YoraiDragon> i played GG, cause it felt good
[3:02:26] <megatonbeef> Give it to me Ustin
[3:02:29] <LaughsWithKnives> thats how we get miek russ back, by killing gg
[3:02:33] <YoraiDragon> the weight class stuff is kinda wack in fighting games tho
[3:02:36] <MikeTales> Im a dumbass so il try it out if its dumbed down
[3:02:37] <FreedomKME> Guilty Gear with 40 Gokus confirmed
[3:02:37] <EroSenpai99> LUL
[3:02:42] <brazil_is_in_da_house> Dont worry ladies im here now to save the chat Kappa LUL OpieOP MingLee EleGiggle PogChamp Kreygasm 4Head
[3:02:45] <DonPunchPunk> Also Gen survived and tied with raging demon
[3:02:47] <ninjavanish> Danger time needs to go
[3:02:54] <inkytheslinky> YRC is fun
[3:02:55] <8PoOryGone8> watch them add more mechanics LUL
[3:02:56] <nahuelpv> They need to buff Johnny IMO
[3:02:57] <MightySandwich> I remember your Stylish Sin combos with auto eating LUL
[3:03:00] <NeoKable_> guilty gear will have v triggers
[3:03:00] <ninjavanish> I like YRC
[3:03:01] <Abstrakt_Logic> Roman Cancel is the core of GG. wtf
[3:03:02] <rashidoo> x-factor is hype :) 🔫
[3:03:04] <RagingMarmot> LUL
[3:03:06] <TheMegamansam> The game at least looks amazing from the trailer
[3:03:10] <caracancel> CRUSH COUNTER IN GG
[3:03:10] <jerich100> Get your monster hand out of my face Alex
[3:03:10] <JBMDoolio> The issue is they dumb it down in wrong ways. They won't touch the convoluted things, but they will set DP's to down down or something.
[3:03:13] <I_nod_my_head_when_I_lose> sudden death smash bros PogChamp
[3:03:21] <ronswanson01> i hope kof 15 looks great
[3:03:29] <CountMeowingtonn> Guilty gear will have G triggers Kappa
[3:03:29] <aitch2o> What's up Vesp. Poison is difficult. stuck on trial 5.
[3:03:38] <FlashyFlash> fadc copied Roman cancel ashlolYay
[3:03:38] <RagingMarmot> same KoF is fun, I hope 15 takes off
[3:03:39] <Abstrakt_Logic> People seemed to like it when it was called FADC instead.
[3:03:40] <8PoOryGone8> auto combos when?
[3:03:42] <Tristar49> Thats true, Gen got the Akuma street cred too
[3:03:46] <JBMDoolio> Posion has that dhalsim/menat timing vibe, big nope from me lol
[3:03:47] <ahrenk> vesper is gonna end up in an alexnaysh compilation
[3:03:50] <YoraiDragon> @Abstrakt_Logic yuuup
[3:03:50] <Kuroen> Yo this overhead looks bad
[3:03:59] <Vexnya> @aitch2o that one took me like 20 mins and then trial 9 took me a legit hour
[3:04:03] <Uchechukwu_Daniel> Capcom cannot keep supporting Street Fighter V forever. The game is almost out of steam.
[3:04:03] <brazil_is_in_da_house> Im prety sure sfv is just usf4 omega mode 2.0 Kappa OpieOP MingLee DatSheffy
[3:04:05] <CountMeowingtonn> that stance cancel is a bitch, you have to slide from punch to kick as fast as you can
[3:04:06] <FreedomKME> i'm down with whatever ArcSys does as long as they don't replace DP motion with down down
[3:04:07] <MikeTales> Her overhead is slow as fuck
[3:04:10] <Abstrakt_Logic> That Cherry picking in the FGC is next level
[3:04:10] <TheJunesPrince> Does the shoulder change depending on the strength of the button you press?
[3:04:11] <ninjavanish> Poisons whip cancel is a pain in the ass for me
[3:04:17] <MikeTales> Like ibuki overhead level of slow
[3:04:18] <rashidoo> did u get it @Bunky0696
[3:04:23] <Guarddoge> @VesperArcade please not bully this Alex. He has it bad already
[3:04:26] <I_nod_my_head_when_I_lose> Oh man that combo is going on his twitter PogChamp Kappa
[3:04:26] <aitch2o> OH NOOO @Vexnya LUL
[3:04:28] <ronswanson01> i forgot alex was in this game
[3:04:31] <brazil_is_in_da_house> Go to usf4 omega mode in sf4 n then play sfv Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa
[3:04:33] <chewccathecat> final fight 3 hype
[3:04:35] <freshcyborg97> More or less mechanics isnt a bad thing, its just if those mechanics are fun or not.
[3:04:47] <ifernoian> i miss fadc cance's from sf4
[3:04:49] <freshcyborg97> Super Dash for ex. is a pain in the ass
[3:04:50] <Blooagentx> random question, is there an Alex player in here in Vespers dojo that played a chun li like 2 hours ago?
[3:04:51] <akaJoness> alex forever low tier
[3:04:51] <Vexnya> @aitch2o yeah trial 9 has the whip cancel in the middle of the combo
[3:04:52] <cool_vargas> do you ever use her target combo?
[3:04:53] <walnutcon> BM
[3:05:02] <azoneling> hows female ken? @VesperArcade

[3:06:22] <yunggrasshopper77> @admiralackbars_snackbar Akuma was the only one who made Oro use his second arm. And he gave Akuma a great fight, Akuma respected him.
[3:06:26] <aitch2o> I can get the whip cancel, but the cr. mp is hard to get. But then, I can start with the cr. mp and do the rest of the trial. If only I can paste the two. LUL

[3:43:39] <69DongerSwag420> does vesper usually have this many viewers i feel like this is a lot
[3:43:40] <intergalacticowl> honda hates degenerates
[3:43:51] <YujiSenpai> like her fireball is decent but can deff can get outzoned
[3:43:57] <ninjavanish> Does Lucia's slide go under projectiles?

[3:45:07] <LaMystika> Hi KonCha I love that your profile name is “KupaKawfee”
[3:45:11] <NecroSeth> Lucia is all together one of the better looking SF5 characters
[3:45:17] <AntonioGiovanna> i agree i would also like to be smothered by her police law enforcing thighs
[3:45:22] <Subdued_subdood> "messing up", it's still working to some extent
[3:45:37] <Azrael_GT> heyo everyone
[3:45:41] <DecoyManta> I wanna pick up Honda but I’m still getting used to his differences from SFIV
[3:45:50] <YujiSenpai> why parry there?

[3:46:58] <MaximumEffor7> @VesperArcade my only question is - can she slide under Lauras Fireball?

[3:47:47] <ghostdog3015> when is the combo video @vesperarcade ?
[3:47:48] <InoriDWF> big steppy
[3:47:52] <saltysusano> lucia is like love child of a mass orgy of other sfv characters
[3:47:55] <Azrael_GT> @megatonbeef good lucj
[3:48:01] <br1x92> like sakura, falke, lucia
[3:48:03] <LaMystika> I thought Kolin was Xenia Onatopp Kappa
[3:48:08] <Beatles3490> Beatles3490 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 12 months, currently on a 12 month streak! Yoo Vesper, hows Lucia going?
[3:48:30] <69DongerSwag420> so vesper its day 2 what tier is honda now that you've played him a lot
[3:48:53] <jurifightsforcapcom> I originally thought she was a ken clone but looking now she is a Seth clone xd
[3:48:56] <Kuroen> It's strange to think that Lucia's moveset is actually legit hers from FF3, yet the resemblance with many other characters moves are undeniable
[3:49:11] <Abstrakt_Logic> How is she like Seth?
[3:49:26] <jurifightsforcapcom> Has moves from many chars
[3:49:34] <LaMystika> I remember Final Fight 3. Lucia was probably the most technical character of the four
[3:49:44] <asceninja> Does the slide go under fireballs?
[3:49:48] <LaMystika> Her super also wasn’t a grab, so I always thought it sucked
[3:49:58] <ustinodj> @rashidoo bully
[3:50:00] <universefour> Lucia or ken?

[3:56:37] <LaMystika> Nice :O
[3:56:42] <Vexnya> honestly I like all the 3 new characters models, they are just so obviosuly better quality than the rest of the cast in most cases.
[3:56:42] <bounty_skull> nice
[3:57:02] <khalz1998> UMESHORYU!
[3:57:09] <br1x92> i completed trials on sakura and they just stayed umcompleted. also didnt get xp for the demonstration @vesperarcade
[3:57:16] <Subdued_subdood> @VesperArcade do you know if Capcom pulled support for some older sticks from the PC version? My TE2 no longer works for SF. I've been trying, but I can't play pad to save my life.
[3:57:17] <ScurvyErm> he finna hurricane kick
[3:57:20] <Kuroen> wait, you can actually hit it CA?
[3:57:27] <DecoyManta> I’m an Alex main but he upsets me too much. Who do you think is a good/similar character to switch to?
[3:57:28] <LaMystika> Wow
[3:57:29] <bounty_skull> nice gg
[3:57:39] <narleyboi> Her ca is dope man
[3:57:40] <br1x92> yup on my main
[3:57:44] <81chilly> @VesperArcade what do u think about poison?
[3:57:47] <machriphi> @Subdued_subdood Steam added PS4 controller support, so you have to enable it through steam.
[3:57:47] <Kuroen> it it AA i mean
[3:57:50] <franzen_fgc> @br1x92 if you dont complete all 10 trials they will still uncompleted
[3:57:52] <TheXIIKing> like @budafuka said, her trigger is more like G's in that it turns her special moves into her amazing EXs by default as opposed to Ken who gets suped up versions of his specials but can still use his EXs
[3:57:58] <budafuka> @decoymanta Play Birdie
[3:58:00] <81chilly> yeah she kind a odd
[3:58:07] <Eiscubes> her whip got a hurtbox, so sad
[3:58:11] <Chicken_Curry_Rice> sakura with free trail atm right
[3:58:12] <br1x92> i completed all 10 and all 10 stayed uncompleted
[3:58:15] <max_difficulty> Hi guys, was there a balance patch with the characters?
[3:58:16] <jurifightsforcapcom> Ok king fair enough
[3:58:20] <81chilly> i dont think so
[3:58:21] <Chicken_Curry_Rice> maybe you don't get anything cuz you don't own her?
[3:58:21] <machriphi> Of course her whip has a hurtbox
[3:58:21] <franzen_fgc> oh then idk
[3:58:26] <whereischarlesIee> Subdued_subdood i think they only pulled support for Dinput devices. i suggest you use steam big picture to get those devices running
[3:58:26] <81chilly> she got crazy stuf
[3:58:26] <Subdued_subdood> @machriphi k, thanks. I'll take a look.
[3:58:27] <DecoyManta> @budafuka I’ll look into it, thanks
[3:58:28] <datzcrazy1> Honda is godlike lol
[3:58:29] <Eiscubes> inb4 daigo jab into super the whip
[3:58:30] <strawhatrein> Sonic liked her
[3:58:31] <wwuuuuu> only volime 4 trials give rewards right
[3:58:32] <81chilly> but odd LUL
[3:58:36] <rfhc5> I remember Sagat was free and I completed the trail, got nothing.
[3:58:36] <ScurvyErm> Fake whip LUL
[3:58:40] <bounty_skull> there's going to be another update in November and December

[3:58:45] <akaJoness> 2 hits from poison = heella dmg
[3:58:46] <ddtyson859> So is lucia good to you?
[3:58:52] <jrrm1234> is good honda? i feel his normals doesnt have good range?
[3:58:55] <Azrael_GT> use your mid kick Alex

[3:59:35] <jurifightsforcapcom> SSGSS akuma PogChamp PogChamp
[3:59:37] <bounty_skull> Honda is good
[3:59:40] <megatonbeef> @azrael_gt The hit stun was so strange I press it but I’m still in block stun
[3:59:43] <NecroSeth> Honda's cool and all, but I wish he would talk about things other than sumo
[3:59:48] <Kaled27> I literally watched a ton of demonstrations to buy Lucia XD
[4:00:04] <budafuka> @khalz1998 Perdon
[4:00:08] <81chilly> she´s a lot more fun than ken
[4:00:08] <Cr0wser> good ol laggy akuma
[4:00:11] <DecoyManta> When an Akuma emerges from amongst the Ryus
[4:00:31] <machriphi> @NecroSeth What is there to talk about besides Sumo?
[4:00:33] <Bairu> Ryu hour is blessing them with additional insight
[4:00:39] <megatonbeef> @necroseth Like chanko stew?
[4:00:40] <Euury> i spent my last FM in kage didn't liked him and unistalled the game since hggOkay

[4:02:47] <Azrael_GT> I couldn't do shiet
[4:02:54] <br1x92> so now i have to do survivsl
[4:02:56] <MaximumEffor7> @Kaled27 its 2 bars, can cancel from any button so you can go a bit risky, its safe on block and the combo extender gives good damage
[4:02:59] <Luca_The_Souza> *no
[4:03:06] <budafuka> budafuka subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! 
[4:03:06] <Delafun> any good player/streamer playing Poison?

[4:03:20] <ddtyson859> Is lucia good in your opinion?

[4:03:51] <F3scorn> The mixups Vesper is referring to - https://twitter.com/mohumohukedama/status/1158398933506252801
[4:03:54] <Kuroen> I like how when on VT1, whenever she puts her weight on one of her feet it sparks
[4:04:04] <Azrael_GT> Ban Rashidoo's Honda
[4:04:09] <Azrael_GT> LUL LUL
[4:04:24] <ustinodj> no
[4:04:25] <whereischarlesIee> lots of smurfs whenever new characters come out MiniK
[4:04:26] <ustinodj> ban honda
[4:04:26] <jurifightsforcapcom> Her v reverse has broken range xd
[4:04:32] <rashidoo> :)
[4:04:33] <Azrael_GT> LUL LUL LUL
[4:04:48] <LaughsWithKnives> whip stance
[4:04:52] <Abstrakt_Logic> She can hold the whip to delay
[4:04:54] <rashidoo> ima switch character
[4:05:08] <Azrael_GT> I'll have to use Mother Russia
[4:05:09] <bounty_skull> has everyone already forgot to play poison
[4:05:10] <whereischarlesIee> doesnt she have like whip stance cancels?
[4:05:17] <Magicjerryfresh11> How negative is run stop on block? Similar to like Ibuki or Laura? Negative out hard to punish?
[4:05:17] <Kibosh_Kaibutsu> i suck LUL

[4:05:29] <Delafun> @franzen_fgc thanks, gonna follow him
[4:05:33] <mike_the_greatest> you can space the shoulder tackle to be safe on block.
[4:05:34] <Euury> rip rank up hggOkay hggOkay hggOkay
[4:05:34] <merophysik> I think Poison might be the most difficult to play out of the three new characters
[4:05:44] <ninjavanish> poisons not an easy character
[4:05:46] <whereischarlesIee> Subdued_subdood steam big picture?
[4:05:49] <mike_the_greatest> You don't think honda is tough to play??? Kappa
[4:05:56] <SinsofBliss> Who is this suppose to be? i havent been paying much attention to SF for months .. ?
[4:05:57] <Azrael_GT> mother Russia made Honda run
[4:05:57] <machriphi> I'm not sure, I think poison might be pretty good, she's just going to take time.
[4:05:59] <RanHibiki > Whip from kof also has whip stance
[4:06:10] <jurifightsforcapcom> playing passive is actually the best way to learn patience and reads imo
[4:06:20] <jurifightsforcapcom> And of course defense
[4:06:32] <SlimeBeherit> ouch
[4:06:36] <Bairu> this poison isn't very good :o
[4:06:36] <mike_the_greatest> the v meter gain on that combo ender is abyssmal. Is it ideal oki?

[4:06:51] <machriphi> Poison has damage, good AAs, good oki, multiple tick throws.
[4:06:52] <Subdued_subdood> @whereischarlesIee I didn't have to go into big picture. Just had to go into settings under the view tab and enable Play station controller support.

[4:07:52] <shevchenko66> Lucia low tier, right Vesper? 4Head
[4:07:53] <SlimeBeherit> @jrrm1234 thats how her super more or less looked in Final Fight 3
[4:07:58] <enzo152> slide
[4:07:59] <ninjavanish> yeah, vskill
[4:08:04] <machriphi> @jurifightsforcapcom EX flip is projectile invul, also you can trade with them with whip specials and it's a winning trade for you
[4:08:06] <Kibosh_Kaibutsu> v skill if your lucky
[4:08:20] <Flak_> her jump forward heavy
[4:08:31] <ScurvyErm> bruh that slide looks hella good
[4:08:31] <machriphi> @jurifightsforcapcom I played against a Sagat and traded with every tiger shot with a whip special and you deal way more damage than he does
[4:08:33] <cmack631> ill play this guy all the time he gets so laggy
[4:08:45] <Azrael_GT> that walk grab

[4:10:38] <elliotterodriguez> FUCKING DBFZ CHARACTER
[4:10:50] <machriphi> Poison's Vskill is not very good for anti fireball. You can't do it on reaction. You can EX flip kick on reaction or just trade with your qcb+mp and it's a positive trade for you
[4:10:56] <enzo152> if they do neutral jump just do heavy dp @VesperArcade vesperCoffee
[4:10:58] <luvmastahchris> So this character is just better ryu

[4:11:49] <rashidoo> did u try aa jab
[4:11:53] <machriphi> @jurifightsforcapcom You go over top of them. But it's too slow and spacing dependent to be consistent

[4:11:54] <Justfullof> Lucia mad better than kage
[4:11:56] <DecoyManta> Not a huge fan of her tights
[4:12:00] <ninjavanish> at least the screen doesn't zoom out like nrs games
[4:12:05] <khalz1998> Why they gotta do Ryu dirty on this game :(
[4:12:05] <Anon9504> v skill after run gives best oki btw

[4:12:46] <senpai817> her tights are perfect fym
[4:12:46] <Chicken_Curry_Rice> im glad the background still moves
[4:12:48] <Rtdc334> Her dp medium and heavy can go through projectiles

[4:49:00] <Iodized_Salt> "Fuck this character" The most natural reaction to fighting Rashid SeemsGood
[4:49:02] <AlexIIDX> he better not be in sf6
[4:49:04] <Menat> Rashid will be nerfed in the future
[4:49:05] <TKimura> rashid is cancer
[4:49:13] <NoJournalistMode> I hope not
[4:49:22] <NoJournalistMode> I wanna see rashid throw out sharknados
[4:49:24] <NoJournalistMode> in the new patch
[4:49:37] <ninjavanish> I only play with 5 bars only and ps4 only now. Most of my matches are good just have to wait for them.
[4:49:42] <Panik64> he can, yeah. it's an issue
[4:49:43] <Iodized_Salt> Rashid broken, what else is new? LUL
[4:49:47] <Iodized_Salt> *is
[4:50:01] <Born_suspect_210> does Rashid even play by the street fighter rules ? mraqua1Pog
[4:50:33] <Iodized_Salt> He can do whatever he wants, most of his shit is plus or 0, it's ridiculous.

[4:50:38] <ustinodj> vesperSpit
[4:50:44] <rashidoo> u bich

[4:51:06] <NaughtyJuri> duDudu RAAASIDO duDudu
[4:51:07] <ninjavanish> geez
[4:51:30] <Iodized_Salt> He has a invincible dp, pressure game, full screen punishes, dude is TOP 3 for a reason/
[4:51:31] <ninjavanish> the un-nerfable character
[4:51:33] <TKimura> vesper have you tried vt2?
[4:51:34] <jurifightsforcapcom> @subdued_subdood guile
[4:51:45] <Subdued_subdood> right
[4:51:47] <Rixean> WAAHOOO!
[4:52:16] <qcfury> I have always hated Rashids design gameplay wise
[4:52:29] <NoJournalistMode> he's wearing a futbol kit
[4:52:29] <jurifightsforcapcom> Actually most chars with a fireball can xd
[4:52:30] <Iodized_Salt> Since day 1 man
[4:52:31] <rashidoo> :O
[4:52:33] <NoJournalistMode> how can you hate him
[4:52:35] <yunggrasshopper77> So cool the way she kicks the fireball straight.
[4:52:37] <rashidoo> hes shown his presence
[4:52:41] <Swaggp_nut> Is her tackle plus on block?
[4:53:04] <rashidoo> oof
[4:53:13] <Hartisas> He reminds me of an El Fuerte that can't grapple
[4:53:16] <F3scorn> no @Swaggp_nut
[4:53:18] <NoJournalistMode> lol
[4:53:21] <F3scorn> -6 IIRC
[4:53:28] <NoJournalistMode> is Lucia from ICE?
[4:53:33] <NoJournalistMode> leave Rashid alone
[4:53:37] <Iodized_Salt> @NoJournalistMode LUL
[4:53:45] <ninjavanish> very good rushdown character
[4:53:45] <casual_hero_> i think a lot of characters were stronger in beta too so all the characters felt good..atleast to me..i love beta 1
[4:53:58] <Iodized_Salt> You gotta respek da luawha
[4:54:13] <yunggrasshopper77> Man Honda stage looks great!
[4:54:20] <nahuelpv> fighting rashid online is such a chore
[4:54:22] <jurifightsforcapcom> I’m glad dp nerfed to the ground lol
[4:54:33] <Iodized_Salt> @nahuelpv *punishment Kappa
[4:54:41] <franzen_fgc> I miss mika getting a wall bounce mid screen off f+mp backdash
[4:54:56] <Rixean> WAAHOOO!
[4:54:59] <Iodized_Salt> WHAT
[4:55:04] <NoJournalistMode> law not respected
[4:55:25] <PaulowebTV> Lucia hype PogChamp
[4:55:27] <jurifightsforcapcom> Nice rashid screw the police
[4:55:30] <sonic_sol> check out my mixtape @VesperArcade https://twitter.com/SonicMonarch/status/1158623405400350720

[4:55:51] <NoJournalistMode> colorway
[4:55:51] <Swaggp_nut> Im not really satisfied with Hondas handslaps and Ryu donkey kick animations
[4:55:53] <Born_suspect_210> Rashid doesn't ever lose a turn or what ? I'm a casual to street fighter 5 somewhat . rarely play it but I had sf5 since release
[4:55:53] <DennyBooiii> rashid is super cool , just gets boring seeing him, just like with every other popular charcter
[4:56:00] <B1ggRandall> brooo!
[4:56:06] <Iodized_Salt> This is Ken's sister right? Kappa
[4:56:12] <drolsij> @Born_suspect_210 you can V Reversal him
[4:56:13] <sonic_sol> its my poison mixtape. the 50/50 mix Vesper
[4:56:20] <Subdued_subdood> A mixtape is a thing people made in the 80s and 90s because they didn't have itunes, Vesper. Learn some culture.
[4:56:21] <pure_kuma> would you like a cup of coffee?
[4:56:24] <slippo> yo vesper

[4:56:50] <kwonton> first vesper needs to learn what a tape is
[4:56:50] <Moobot> Join the Vesper Arcade Discord at https://discord.gg/esjX5km
[4:56:50] <Born_suspect_210> Rashid playstyle is like kung Lao from mortal kombat 11 somewhat .
[4:56:59] <cheddajones92> Lucia looks Kreygasm
[4:57:06] <Hurked> A mixtape is you could hear if you bought my fire track
[4:57:06] <NoJournalistMode> yo I hope next DLC is adon

[4:57:15] <F3scorn> no
[4:57:17] <SiPoLanAtaN> @abonplex hie ✌️
[4:57:17] <8_drunken_gods> how do you even make a mixtape???
[4:57:22] <Born_suspect_210> Rashids tornado to constantly take another turn reminds me of mk11 kung Lao throwing out his hat to take another turn
[4:57:27] <megatonbeef> @b1ggrandall No just characters
[4:57:34] <jurifightsforcapcom> by minus I mean punishable xd
[4:57:36] <Ravaloft> lol. come with. why would Capcom give anything for free
[4:57:40] <yunggrasshopper77> Vesper I thought you was old school. You don’t know what a mixtape is! Smh @vesperarcade

[5:00:10] <cheddajones92> @ninjavanish I think thats the pointbSkelator Urien
[5:00:15] <drolsij> Lucia seems to be good at giving gray life
[5:01:01] <KingSweatpants> this used to be an e honda stream FeelsBadMan
[5:01:04] <jay_1712> pardon isn't spanish...
[5:01:17] <FenixGCL> STOP DASHINNG

[5:01:28] <gullwingss> i like the explosion after CA
[5:01:43] <jurifightsforcapcom> Perdon is right sorry
[5:02:01] <jurifightsforcapcom> Her accent when she says pardon makes me think she is saying perdon xd
[5:02:17] <jay_1712> haha lol yeah
[5:02:20] <yunggrasshopper77> @vesperarcade what are your total thoughts on the Dragon? After playing with is this long now.
[5:02:24] <drolsij> Online in Japan is nice, there's not so much lag.
[5:02:26] <cheddajones92> Poop on doodSteve thats what I hear
[5:02:32] <Solideva> oh my God please urien player stop dashing. you're giving us a bad name
[5:03:06] <KingSweatpants> big stick gang Kappa

[5:03:30] <cheddajones92> STUNNED LUL
[5:03:33] <Swaggp_nut> Does anyone know where I can get my Panthera cable fixed without doing it myself?
[5:03:47] <ninjavanish> @VesperArcade you play stick on a table?
[5:04:15] <kwonton> @Swaggp_nut just do it urself can order cable parts from jasens or other arcade shops. otherwise youll be paying for massive shipping fees and service fees
[5:04:34] <Ravaloft> @swaggp_nut if under warranty call razer. they'll want to rma the whole stick. but you'll get a brand new one back. razer doesn't do refurbishments
[5:04:37] <yunggrasshopper77> Somebody brought his in the restroom at CB. I was looking like dude really?! Get a bag
[5:04:45] <ninjavanish> LUL
[5:04:52] <Swaggp_nut> I watched Jasens tutorial, the only part I'm uncomfortable with is the soldering cause I don't know how
[5:04:58] <yunggrasshopper77> @swaggp_nut try paradise arcade
[5:05:09] <kwonton> id buy a spare pcb board and just practice @Swaggp_nut
[5:05:28] <kwonton> any blank board as practice
[5:05:30] <cheddajones92> I love this tech doodGood
[5:05:32] <DanglingDankDoge> how was her mixup
[5:05:33] <cheddajones92> talk
[5:05:35] <SquallAdv> @VesperArcade Vesp what do you think are Lucia best neutral moves?
[5:05:35] <yunggrasshopper77> I saw Sanford kelly playing with his on the floor before.
[5:05:37] <qcfury> you might be able to go to a PC repair shop, they might be able to help
[5:05:46] <oldschoolReflexes> that Urien is def saying "wtf" heh heh
[5:05:47] <tomfromtheclouds> Good morning @vesperarcade & chat! FutureMan What's up?
[5:05:52] <ninjavanish> on the floor, like sitting Indian style and shit?
[5:05:57] <tomfromtheclouds> What's the verdict on Lucia after 2 days? Yay or nay?
[5:05:57] <bobbyjoe001> Criss cross applesauce?
[5:05:58] <Swaggp_nut> Thanks I will start with that. Do you know if I would need to mod the new cable to the board too?
[5:06:09] <kwonton> depends on the structure inside the panthera
[5:06:12] <kwonton> what exactly is wrong
[5:06:15] <afropower> The Hedgehog?
[5:06:17] <nahuelpv> what VT activation is better? 1 or 2?
[5:06:20] <kwonton> is the cable frayed/busted or the connection
[5:06:27] <casual_hero_> oh a ryu
[5:06:32] <SquallAdv> Thx =)
[5:06:39] <cheddajones92> Rayu doodHokey
[5:06:40] <Swaggp_nut> @kwonton the connection. It would work in certain positions but not anymore
[5:06:42] <jurifightsforcapcom> Be happy you have a c trig cancelabke v skilll PJSalt
[5:06:43] <strawhatrein> Do you have a Poison combo vid coming soon @VesperArcade
[5:06:55] <yunggrasshopper77> @swaggp_nut well ask for Tim he will know all that stuff. I met him @ CB
[5:07:16] <xcarbn> its that ryu chogpamp
[5:07:30] <ustinodj> I forgot combos Kappa
[5:07:33] <Bairu> when is the alex trailer coming out?
[5:07:36] <rashidoo> me too Kappa
[5:07:39] <kwonton> @Swaggp_nut ask r/fightsticks they will know everything for a fix on the connection. i dont own a panthera so i dont know how its wired up
[5:07:54] <Abonplex> this is the arc fireball would like to K'
[5:08:07] <ninjavanish> @strawhatrein sonicsol has a lot of poison stuff on his twitter right now. Good shit.
[5:08:22] <yunggrasshopper77> @vesperarcade you should do a trials video featuring the Qanba Dragon.
[5:08:23] <strawhatrein> oh nice @ninjavanish
[5:08:54] <lock__m> have tried using df+lk to avoid crossups? works pretty well
[5:08:56] <bulldogmicrowave> that was clean
[5:09:11] <answer_the_call_2016> nude mod already out
[5:09:23] <jurifightsforcapcom> I’m glad my hood is giving vesper a little trouble
[5:09:36] <drolsij> @jurifightsforcapcom your hood is platinum?
[5:09:45] <TetsuJack> loL are we still on Lucia? No Honda or Poison yet?
[5:10:00] <jurifightsforcapcom> I’m super platinum but it’s all the same to me xd
[5:10:07] <Vexnya> @TetsuJack it's been a day
[5:10:10] <yunggrasshopper77> @kwonton I own a Panthera best stick I ever own and I have a few of them.
[5:10:11] <drolsij> Haha, I just hit superplat today
[5:10:16] <yunggrasshopper77> Owned
[5:10:25] <qcfury> Zoning is already trash in this game they might as well just bring parries back and give Ryu a new v skill
[5:10:29] <kwonton> @yunggrasshopper77 i have custom metal and my own self made with wood so i dont really need a plastic thing :d
[5:10:38] <Teh_Wrecker> these characters gotta last 4 months
[5:10:57] <jurifightsforcapcom> I don’t like universal parry idea, this is not 3rd strike
[5:11:05] <yunggrasshopper77> @kwonton I was interested in the wooden hitbox.
[5:11:19] <fuzzyrpg> that did no damage for a trigger combo
[5:11:27] <AdjustKiefer> Vesper stop farming that poor Ryu
[5:11:35] <FGCDisturbed> vesper actually leaked everything, he has the game for about 1 week, don't get fooled, guys
[5:11:57] <qcfury> people love 3rd strike and you could have a simple 2 button command or the of directional button method, that would be sick
[5:11:59] <ustinodj> @rashidoo I guess I am a middle man cause jurifan says gg
[5:12:12] <qcfury> *og
[5:12:15] <drolsij> I'm waiting for Vesp to hit around my rank and see if I get matched with him
[5:12:36] <FenixGCL> she has bad neutral, but a slide?
[5:12:41] <lock__m> did chat force you to play lucia? LUL
[5:12:43] <Cranberrypudding> i've matched with him once but i'm workin on getting him again
[5:12:46] <rashidoo> ggs
[5:12:49] <sonic_sol> ?
[5:12:51] <sonic_sol> up
[5:12:53] <sonic_sol> yo
[5:12:54] <Cranberrypudding> i keep getting everyone he plays but not him
[5:12:58] <jurifightsforcapcom> people like sf4 and people like st, doesn’t mean we should turn sf5 into those games
[5:13:06] <sonic_sol> https://twitter.com/SonicMonarch/status/1158623405400350720
[5:13:14] <trumyolo> Poison was top tier Kappa
[5:13:22] <Bunky0696> PogChamp
[5:13:22] <sonic_sol> no
[5:13:25] <sonic_sol> i just made that
[5:13:25] <Slowmosapien> Yall doing a lobby?
[5:13:38] <tomfromtheclouds> Vesper, Is Lucia strong and/or fun to play then?
[5:13:47] <lock__m> what about using spaced burnkicks? i guess big commitment though
[5:13:59] <ninjavanish> LUL
[5:14:05] <qcfury> SFV is already to different from 3rd Strike to be 3rd Strike. parries would just give it a defensive aspect it really needs
[5:14:26] <ninjavanish> Yo vesper why you blocking sonic
[5:14:49] <sonic_sol> It just burns life and causes juggle state @VesperArcade
[5:14:52] <FGCDisturbed> @qcfury stop with the defensive bullshit
[5:15:01] <FGCDisturbed> too much defensive options make the fucking game bad
[5:15:11] <ninjavanish> good damage, though
[5:15:18] <sonic_sol> 574 is her max damage so far
[5:15:20] <sonic_sol> this combo
[5:15:20] <jurifightsforcapcom> Have back dash seems fast
[5:15:22] <quoji> thought I saw lucia deal 568 too
[5:15:32] <sonic_sol> VT1 is what i have been using so far
[5:15:39] <qcfury> If you think defense is bullshit, that's problem enough
[5:15:42] <meatandteam> better defensive options is better than shitty comeback mechanics
[5:15:48] <ninjavanish> LUL
[5:15:57] <sonic_sol> LUL
[5:16:04] <lionheartrawr> bm?
[5:16:10] <the_mega_guy_> wut does bm mean?
[5:16:13] <sonic_sol> I am bm incarnate baby
[5:16:17] <jurifightsforcapcom> 500+ dmg off of a stun... feels bad man :(
[5:16:18] <sonic_sol> BEEE MMMMM
[5:16:21] <LordHisoka_> baby mama
[5:16:22] <quoji> "bad manner"
[5:16:24] <blood_wizardd> bitchmade
[5:16:27] <jejune21> night elf imo
[5:16:32] <yunggrasshopper77> @lionheartrawr I’m with you bm?
[5:16:33] <Ryzzl> it means bowel movement
[5:16:37] <the_mega_guy_> LUL
[5:16:40] <sonic_sol> Yeah VT1 poison just burns
[5:16:43] <FGCDisturbed> ''blablabla defensive options, I wanna be random and get away with my bad plays''
[5:16:45] <sonic_sol> and you can pin them down
[5:16:56] <qcfury> You must run that G-Train on people if you think defense is bad Kappa
[5:16:58] <sonic_sol> Nah I 100 percent BM
[5:16:59] <Gimme_Makoto> @fgcdisturbed nice counter point there
[5:17:02] <SpaceDive> BM is SFV in a nutshell
[5:17:06] <foxide_> poor vesper
[5:17:07] <tomfromtheclouds> What's Bork?
[5:17:09] <yunggrasshopper77> Take the 4 bar Vesper
[5:17:11] <foxide_> he gets treated badly
[5:17:25] <rashidoo> yogaaaa
[5:17:27] <drolsij> rollback lag hurts
[5:17:29] <rashidoo> fuq
[5:17:35] <sonic_sol> When you learn poison
[5:17:40] <sonic_sol> you're gonna find out how od she is
[5:17:44] <sonic_sol> and how ez she is
[5:17:54] <SpaceDive> desk put a honda video today
[5:17:56] <sonic_sol> She's not that hard
[5:17:57] <drolsij> Oh wow, is that how you can avoid people in ranked? Just hit blacklist
[5:18:01] <Cranberrypudding> bm means bowel movement or bmw
[5:18:01] <sonic_sol> just the stance cancel bruh
[5:18:03] <Cranberrypudding> or bad manners
[5:18:07] <Cranberrypudding> pick your poison
[5:18:07] <sonic_sol> Vote poison chat
[5:18:10] <meatandteam> @FGCDisturbed blabla bad play lets me just use my comeback bar for a free combo extension and then mixup BrokeBack
[5:18:14] <yunggrasshopper77> What you need is another Honda player to come
[5:18:17] <sonic_sol> get a bunch of people in here talking about "her"
[5:18:25] <jurifightsforcapcom> You think piano is simple?
[5:18:29] <sonic_sol> i hated that so much i had to blow them up for it
[5:19:01] <drolsij> Who's an easy top tier to pick up? No bm

[5:21:16] <Chicken_Curry_Rice> fchamp also says marvel 4 is a thing Kappa
[5:21:34] <jurifightsforcapcom> Medium kick and run away lol
[5:21:39] <drolsij> haha
[5:21:44] <terrywolf1> FChamp just wants some clout
[5:21:58] <ThatNinjaOstrich> I'm tempted to buy a Victrix Pro, but Idk if It's really worth it. I have a Razer Atrox atm. Should I just mod and keep the one I have, or go for the sweet slickness of Victrix lol
[5:22:07] <jurifightsforcapcom> If gief starts using counter use st hk? Also her st hk stupid good range very good for neutral
[5:22:27] <rashidoo> reeee
[5:22:37] <ustinodj> favorite part of poison are the sick super confirms
[5:22:48] <Nonlinear314> she is thicc tier
[5:22:51] <drolsij> Nice, I'm just afraid of grapplers but she is definitely solid
[5:22:57] <rashidoo> except when, u kno
[5:22:59] <rashidoo> Kappa
[5:23:05] <ustinodj> it misses Kappa
[5:23:37] <ustinodj> dont tell anymore but I can only do the confirm on p2 side vesperPeek
[5:24:06] <ThatNinjaOstrich> Does Poison count as a grappler? Or more hybrid
[5:24:26] <ThatNinjaOstrich> with V2 that us
[5:24:29] <ThatNinjaOstrich> *is
[5:24:41] <megatonbeef> Command grab is only with vtrigger 2 not a grappler
[5:25:00] <sup3lolzx> i have fight money to buy poison or lucia, i have no idea on who to buy
[5:25:06] <ustinodj> poison VT2 is more of a combo extender
[5:25:08] <FGCDisturbed> old man reactions
[5:25:10] <megatonbeef> @sup3lolzx Lucia
[5:25:51] <ThatNinjaOstrich> I hardly see Hondas. Tempted to buy him and just buttslam all day Kappa
[5:26:07] <KanjiMonster> Is lucia like rush down Kolin? monkaS
[5:26:31] <sup3lolzx> lucia gives me kof vibes
[5:26:39] <DTested> i think you could have caught him off guard with ex fireball
[5:26:45] <DTested> since it bounces
[5:26:50] <rashidoo> last 1 4 me
[5:27:10] <yunggrasshopper77> I like that color he has

[5:27:30] <rashidoo> with a twist Kappa
[5:27:30] <TheXIIKing> kolin is already rushdown
[5:27:41] <ThatNinjaOstrich> Out of the 3 Vesper, who do you think is the strongest?
[5:28:10] <KanjiMonster> top 50,000 PogChamp

[6:08:01] <grumpyillegal> Chunli look more like a whitegirl than Asian
[6:08:18] <DreamYusuke> @SlimeBeherit lol right. i just hated being camped by guile, meaty by r mika, stomp by abi, bullshitted by akuma, and asswhopped by cammy. it made me not want to play the game. Also my my buddy borrowed my ps4 for like a month and brought my ranked down super plat to super silver. lol
[6:08:20] <Bairu> Chun looks like Lili
[6:08:48] <Sundett> how long is Lucias confirm window off a cr mk?
[6:08:59] <NaughtyJuri> Nice
[6:09:53] <SlimeBeherit> @DreamYusuke Yeah, I've definitely been there, and none of that would be a major issue if the netcode was better. Ugh, getting through gold is pretty tough after getting better at the game, so good luck with ranking back up!
[6:09:54] <bobdobbz> Eat your DP clean huh

[6:12:45] <SlimeBeherit> @DreamYusuke ah i see. I never really enjoyed SF4, but mostly for cosmetic reasons
[6:13:36] <Sundett> Do you think Lucia has potential? Kappa
[6:13:53] <Brivin> Chun super is -20
[6:14:36] <hidesmile> Damn this looks unfun
[6:14:48] <cowlikesapricot> Both kinda zoning and rushdown
[6:14:48] <NaughtyJuri> Wonder which pro player gonna pick up Lucia in tournaments
[6:15:10] <hidesmile> That’ll be momochi
[6:15:18] <Hulkbusterv3> A lot of people are playing her right now so we'll see
[6:15:23] <adeadmanswonderland> Lucia is probably going to be the strongest char out of the 3
[6:16:03] <wingmasterjr> y

[6:24:04] <Carparkc> Minus, but it can be zero
[6:24:04] <ThatNinjaOstrich> It's safe I think
[6:24:05] <Syntax_FF> i heard heavy and ex are -2, others -4?
[6:24:07] <rashidoo> and the heavy kick may be safe ob
[6:24:11] <Frutamare> the sfv special
[6:24:13] <thekurrgan> wow dude was asleep
[6:24:13] <Syntax_FF> but maybe spaced
[6:24:28] <NaughtyJuri> Ono here’s poison. Yes yes she thicc I love it Shoryuken! LUL
[6:24:38] <czash123> how long did it take you to get comfortable playing stick @VesperArcade
[6:25:11] <ThatNinjaOstrich> I like the animation of Lucia's backdash. Like she's dodging
[6:25:18] <icexvader> She’s looking like she just came from cursing out the restaurant manager and also that her name is Karen
[6:25:39] <Plutorino> @Plutorino is new here. Say hello! SeemsGood
[6:25:55] <The_Enygma> @icexvader did you just assume her gender?! HotPokket
[6:26:16] <thekurrgan> bullshit you grew up on the arcades..
[6:26:25] <whereischarlesIee> karin is a different character MiniK
[6:26:26] <thekurrgan> that or nature is very nice to you
[6:26:31] <ThatNinjaOstrich> Poison looks really cool though, I might grind out free days on SFV and get some fight money to buy her
[6:26:47] <icexvader> @the_enygma My apologies. I will say “IT” from now on. Please forgive me
[6:26:52] <NaughtyJuri> I wish when playing a new character your points for that character changed
[6:27:00] <ustinodj> @rashidoo heavy kick ob is punishable
[6:27:02] <The_Enygma> ;)

[6:28:17] <ustinodj> and a duck
[6:28:18] <FalcieGaiah> or prob it's all that poison skin Kappa
[6:28:26] <rashidoo> and an ape
[6:28:26] <Sir_Bushy_Brows> This poison has not done a single combo. All her damage is from stray hits. Impressive
[6:28:28] <icexvader> Karen vs The Manager
[6:28:50] <ustinodj> and a...I dunno I cant think of anything else
[6:28:55] <rashidoo> deejay fanboy

[6:30:06] <NaughtyJuri> Ahh
[6:30:08] <sa1k0> Poison is almost on par with Chun's thickness bleedPurple
[6:30:35] <ustinodj> Im pretty sure poison is literally thiccer cause she is heavier and taller
[6:30:39] <SquallAdv> Lucia is more thicc than any in the game tbh
[6:31:00] <yunggrasshopper77> @ustinodj yup even thicker, or the same
[6:31:01] <ThatNinjaOstrich> Thicc award goes to honda
