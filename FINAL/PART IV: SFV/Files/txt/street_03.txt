[2:58:38] <jamuck> man look how fast this game loads
[2:58:40] <bebopaloobop> i don't think the stun bar being visible is an issue in sf5 as much as how homogenized stun damage is
[2:58:41] <numbnumb_juice> why are you so good
[2:58:47] <elliotterodriguez> @sungazes well yeah that's why people learn to adapt that's why smug gets top 8 and Tokido won Evo
[2:58:50] <numbnumb_juice> ???
[2:58:56] <bebopaloobop> like in 3s not every char was stunning you
[2:59:05] <Craaazybus> Wow overhead
