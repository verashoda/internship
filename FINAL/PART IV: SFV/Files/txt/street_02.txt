[0:14:04] <Leo_the_Lion25> Buff and Nerfs?
[0:14:06] <Abstrakt_Logic> @intergalacticowl You already knew that. People cried for him just to not play him.
[0:14:08] <daMuffinMan007> btw, that is not a New York accent, it's a New Jersey accent Kappa
[0:14:09] <VariantX7> I might actually be playing SFV again...what is this timeline
[0:14:14] <daMuffinMan007> just to get the record straight
[0:14:19] <intergalacticowl> @daMuffinMan007 uh no it's not

[0:14:50] <b1gam3r> trials bois
[0:14:52] <Abstrakt_Logic> @intergalacticowl Just because he was in 2....which isn't the original....he HAS to be here.
[0:14:57] <monjafighter> thanks mate
[0:14:57] <I_nod_my_head_when_I_lose> Vesper knows his audience
[0:14:59] <daMuffinMan007> I live in Brooklyn, def not a Brooklyn accent LUL
[0:14:59] <spydermanga> How's her projectiles?
[0:15:01] <VariantX7> @quoji dropped 8/4
[0:15:02] <tumspoog> gotta wait until 2020 for another 5 lines of inconsequential changes
[0:15:05] <Sandman444a> sinking ship
[0:15:06] <I_nod_my_head_when_I_lose> super feelsbadman
[0:15:09] <Llesor> 99% CHANCE
[0:15:10] <Kirblar> there were a lot of bugfixes though
[0:15:10] <supremecoy> Vesper hope this holds till november
[0:15:11] <Hydrop0nica> smugelineVaseline smugelineVaseline smugelineVaseline smugelineVaseline smugelineVaseline smugelineVaseline
[0:15:11] <69DongerSwag420> lmfao
[0:15:14] <the_mega_guy_> no balance patch vesperKilley
[0:15:20] <Alexander_Heinz> Rashid Karin ResidentSleeper
[0:15:23] <KingFossilFER> @VesperArcade https://game.capcom.com/cfn/sfv/systemfault/132792?lang=en
[0:15:28] <Moravia> ResidentSleeper karin, akuma and forever
[0:15:33] <Kirblar> the bug fixes are actually kind of significant depending on the character
[0:15:40] <Leo_the_Lion25> Well, I heard EVO 2019 was 7 different characters in top 8? So that is good news?
[0:15:54] <8PoOryGone8> too late for a patch this season
[0:15:54] <InfectedJazz> is it a good thing to balance the game in the middle of the cpt?
[0:15:58] <supremecoy> Rashid forever CoolCat
[0:16:01] <daMuffinMan007> who needs balance in a fighting game LUL
[0:16:03] <chipi086> k'
[0:16:06] <SquallAdv> she's hot CurseLit
[0:16:07] <Azrael_GT> hacky sack?
[0:16:08] <InfectedJazz> I would expect a balance patch after capcom cup.
[0:16:15] <VariantX7> SFV is the game with weird fireballs for most of the new cast
[0:16:17] <NYCness> evo thoughts?
[0:16:19] <Yamsandjams> can it bounce off the wall??
[0:16:22] <Jackedalot123> They usually have a mid season patch after Evo
[0:16:30] <tumspoog> if it makes the game more enjoyable to watch who cares when the balance patch is
[0:16:32] <quoji> @InfectedJazz it's limited to once or twice a year (after evo, after capcup), not bad
[0:16:43] <snakehead540> whats her v-skill?
[0:16:44] <Llesor> MINUS 4????
[0:16:49] <Llesor> oh no boys
[0:16:51] <rfhc5> Kinda reminds me of Ken with Dhalsim fireballs
[0:16:51] <Llesor> oh no
[0:16:51] <Yamsandjams> -4? So it's Juri stHK LUL
[0:16:55] <InfectedJazz> @quoji oh are the .5 patches usually after evo?
[0:16:56] <Leo_the_Lion25> MK11 needs a balance patch. everyone only used 5% of the roaster
[0:16:57] <spydermanga> @VesperArcade how's her VRev?
[0:17:02] <quoji> last year there was
[0:17:02] <SquallAdv> 99% feels S4 is super balanced, why balance patch? Just delete Karin.
[0:17:03] <gruff_gridof> can you space it?
[0:17:04] <Llesor> HELL YEAH
[0:17:11] <freakyyyy8> Trials will get you started man!
[0:17:13] <Bipolarcougar> are you going to release a guide
[0:17:13] <69DongerSwag420> how + is her overhead on ch
[0:17:14] <8PoOryGone8> that avoids lows?
[0:17:16] <official_nakmatic> By anime standards, -4 is great
[0:17:19] <MadTheMerc88> So she’s kinda like a shoto?
[0:17:24] <b1gam3r> I thought the character were free for two days
[0:17:28] <rfhc5> At least Fei Long would be different
[0:17:29] <Jackedalot123> There’s enough pushback
[0:17:30] <b1gam3r> characters
[0:17:34] <freakyyyy8> not bad at allll! not -10 like falke
[0:17:35] <greyseerrob> DF LK is a Sim slide
[0:17:39] <NYCness> evo thoughts?
[0:17:41] <rashidoo> where do i go to see hitboxes again
[0:17:44] <the__djoker> what's her super?
[0:17:48] <garlandu> I'm so glad you like Lucia :)
[0:17:49] <daMuffinMan007> game itself is on free trial, not the chars tho
[0:17:53] <Yamsandjams> I believe the season 3 characters are part of the free trial, of which this character isn't one
[0:18:08] <Kei_Kei_978> Can u believe samsho has free dlc?!

[0:43:50] <VariantX7> Put Guy in the game so he can also beat up Abigail
[0:44:29] <someguy_zero> She's like the anti-Kolin. Fire vs. Ice Kreygasm
[0:44:31] <kcomplex1> What I learned from the story is that Cody was buying some good good off of zeku than zeku saw the cop and dipped and then Lucia doesn’t get payed enough money
[0:44:34] <chikenlittle88> lucia = jill
[0:44:36] <Hulkbusterv3> She has a really good AA
[0:44:40] <akinohamlet> I wish capcom got a hard on for rival schools and start putting those characters in the game
[0:44:47] <akinohamlet> the final fight well has dried up
[0:44:47] <mr__lawyer> she looks like tina from dead or alive

[0:47:57] <SquallAdv> Lucia animations looks awesome

[1:37:08] <SHINBAXTER> her upwards fireball looks WELL goofy
[1:37:09] <CountMeowingtonn> @VesperArcade I've seen some crazy poison shit, she might get picked up
[1:37:12] <fighterinthestreet> She seems like a low budget character
[1:37:13] <someguy_zero> Best blond in the game Kreygasm
[1:37:15] <Magicjerryfresh11> This seems like a sako replacement for Kage
[1:37:19] <fighterinthestreet> Will you playbpoison?
[1:37:20] <DangalfTheKrey> she has good corner carry. she's like a mix of ken/sakura/ratshit
[1:37:22] <NinoDiablo> Fireballs give a lot of lockdown optiobs
[1:37:22] <slylataupe> Honda ! Honda ! Plzzz
[1:37:26] <8PoOryGone8> better fireball than Kage
[1:37:26] <snowfarmer81> Honda is fun
[1:37:27] <NinoDiablo> Options
[1:37:29] <awoo07> how is her vskill
[1:37:30] <Daveski_215> yeah it is
[1:37:31] <taurusmagnus> She looks hella fun. Poison too
[1:37:33] <Spookyleonnueve> wack, Honda good. they could've picked 2 better characters
[1:37:36] <staycookin10> anybody have a link for the psn bundle?
[1:37:36] <Daveski_215> I'm actually surprised by Honda
[1:37:42] <Yamsandjams> Sin tech!? WutFace
[1:37:44] <CountMeowingtonn> ZA WARUDO
[1:37:44] <NinoDiablo> Standing idle animation is weird
[1:37:49] <valerio123br> oTrust, only smurfs today....please Mau5
[1:37:51] <Clinnamon> activated his stand
[1:37:53] <fyz1x> @Magicjerryfresh11 Sako gonna have a ball with her for sure.
[1:37:55] <jaynines> is bundle out on PSN?
[1:37:59] <redpotato> Mario fireball
[1:38:00] <someguy_zero> Non-VT Necalli LUL
[1:38:02] <CountMeowingtonn> he activated king crimson lul
[1:38:05] <Spookyleonnueve> makoto would've been better
[1:38:10] <megatonbeef> @jaynines Don’t see it yet
[1:38:13] <8PoOryGone8> @NinoDiablo final fight pose soo it looks weird
[1:38:17] <ninjavanish> They must have wifi in that bath house
[1:38:18] <hennesyhufflepuf> lovd it
[1:38:21] <hennesyhufflepuf> loved
[1:38:22] <rashidoo> harada doesnt give a fook
[1:38:24] <RedHotJoe> LUL
[1:38:28] <Eltanin_Z> what did he say?
[1:38:32] <Yamsandjams> What are friends for? LUL
[1:38:33] <Emp_cannedpasta> There is no leaks lmaoooooooo
[1:38:34] <Hurked> Don't ask him for shit
[1:38:34] <gruff_gridof> the SC guy took a shot at them too
[1:38:36] <taken351> poor ono
[1:38:38] <rashidoo> "dont ask me for sh~t"
[1:38:39] <shinzo1987> iy wasnt even capcoms fault about the leaks it was valve
[1:38:40] <Daveski_215> He made fun of Soul Calibers choppy video too
[1:38:41] <brandx_76> Honda on vt has mad comeback if you can't as on reflex
[1:38:43] <someguy_zero> Bet Ono will get revenge next year
[1:38:43] <Kibosh_Kaibutsu> !uptime
[1:38:44] <Moobot> Vesperarcade has been streaming for 1h 38m
[1:38:45] <SpaceDive> so what was that metal gear thing? snake for tekken?
[1:38:50] <DangalfTheKrey> harada, AND okubo fired shots on ono LUL
[1:38:50] <RagingMarmot> tough love
[1:38:51] <that_japanese_dude> Ono came out with an aplogy scroll on stage and Harada parodied it
[1:38:53] <SquallAdv> LUL
[1:38:55] <megatonbeef> Bro the arcs system guy talked shit on ono and got booed for it
[1:39:00] <Kibosh_Kaibutsu> damn it, missed the beginning parts
[1:39:03] <boredom325> soul caliber guy made fun of Ono too
[1:39:04] <015kirb> what did harada do
[1:39:04] <horseapples> harada is lucky people have low standards and seem to lap up tekken
[1:39:04] <RealTIER> atpHarada don’t ask me for shit
[1:39:07] <Spookyleonnueve> eagle would have been awesome
[1:39:08] <LaughsWithKnives> atpHarada we dont have leaks cuz we dont have shit
[1:39:13] <that_japanese_dude> That was the SC6 guy.
[1:39:14] <RagingMarmot> they probably knew it was GabeN
[1:39:17] <NinoDiablo> @8poorygone8 I'll have to look at some Final Fight 3 videos again
[1:39:18] <8PoOryGone8> EVO did that snake thing
[1:39:20] <Kristoffers> you did start with Lucia! I love it
[1:39:22] <SquallAdv> more smurf??
[1:39:27] <Xer0_1> love this new stage
[1:39:32] <SquallAdv> this one is not bronze at all LUL
[1:39:33] <RoninWoof> wait.. why do people hate Necali again?
[1:39:34] <megatonbeef> @8poorygone8 Rude to do
[1:39:35] <JAR2388_> Lucia = Generic Sonya ResidentSleeper
[1:39:41] <Kibosh_Kaibutsu> so how is she?
[1:39:47] <that_japanese_dude> machabo tho
[1:39:48] <ensanesane> I like necalli
[1:39:52] <fyz1x> Shoulder combos from heavies, and you can link a cr.LP after it.
[1:39:52] <snowfarmer81> He is no unga at all
[1:39:54] <8PoOryGone8> They thought it was funny
[1:39:55] <Raino0_> hes unga
[1:39:57] <Raino0_> and hes bunga
[1:39:58] <LaLiLuLeLolz> Only good thing about necalli is his theme
[1:40:04] <Daveski_215> I like how the water splashes at their feet
[1:40:12] <Cryojazz> compared to top tiers in s4 necalli is honest LUL
[1:40:13] <someguy_zero> Should have been Bonchan vs. Machabo GF.
[1:40:17] <topgunLT1> epic paid valve employee to do the leak, they are taking this opportunity to embarass steam Kappa
[1:40:21] <theMrHeadache> Necalli is the most basic character in the game. He's just really solid, which means he's good. And people whine and cry over any character that's better than theirs.
[1:40:23] <Hulkbusterv3> He's a jobber too.
[1:40:30] <swiftruina> Necalli is just lame and the story mode solidified that. I don’t see him coming back in the future.
[1:40:37] <NinoDiablo> Her fireballs and kick specials are good
[1:40:38] <CountMeowingtonn> @VesperArcade I think poison is gonna get picked up by someone, she's got some good shit
[1:40:41] <crypticrumpet> unfortunate drop
[1:40:41] <LaLiLuLeLolz> Isn't Lucia like the third character to have that exact same heavy kick animation?
[1:40:45] <AdversaryOne> I don't see the bundle anywjere
[1:40:45] <LaLiLuLeLolz> Her Kolin and someone else
[1:40:46] <donh98> what announcement got you the most hyped vesper?
[1:40:53] <ensanesane> You could do the up fireball into safe tackle right?
[1:40:56] <Melloww7> @lalilulelolz cody
[1:41:00] <Tuxadracles> Lucia is actually fun, and overall this was a good character pack
[1:41:03] <Kibosh_Kaibutsu> first playing Lucia
[1:41:04] <freakyyyy8> Sagat & G was HYPE AF
[1:41:05] <Spookyleonnueve> honda looks the best
[1:41:06] <snowfarmer81> his forward dash is pretty fast
[1:41:07] <RoninWoof> Wait why is Necalli Unga Bunga? i thought you had to play him well. and his wins are honest. he doesnt seem brain dead and cheap like some top tiers
[1:41:11] <Fedorabattlemaster> Poison, blanka and Vega have command grabs wtf is happening
[1:41:15] <LaLiLuLeLolz> I also noticed her run tackle is the chariot tackle animation
[1:41:16] <thecheeze09> everyone thought that necalli is a catalyst for gill, but ended up being a jobber
[1:41:16] <Fedorabattlemaster> KUBO PogChamp
[1:41:18] <megatonbeef> @donh98 Defiantly the tank for blazeblue x
[1:41:18] <Kristoffers> lucia can't stand still lol
[1:41:19] <dnut999> Mike Ross will come back for Honda
[1:41:19] <someguy_zero> Daigo will try out Honda Kappa
[1:41:23] <snowfarmer81> and walk speed is good
[1:41:24] <GoldCarats> The classic stage!!!!!
[1:41:25] <SweetBabyBuddha> but where miek russ? FeelsBadMan
[1:41:27] <fighterinthestreet> Honda and poison look super cool, Lucia looks stiff
[1:41:28] <JustTheNorm> wait we still gotta buy these chars?
[1:41:29] <8PoOryGone8> Necalli was hyped in the trailers as this guy who will give Ryu trouble but he just turns out like a lame character who gets beaten by everyone
[1:41:31] <RedHotJoe> beefy Kreygasm
[1:41:31] <crypticrumpet> honda seems legit good
[1:41:32] <SlimCrim> Honda and Poison look like they have damage to be viable, Lucia scaling worries me
[1:41:34] <DomadorMilagroso> sorry, i miss the start of the stream. What about Honda? is cool?
[1:41:41] <Thiir> does lucia low foward cancelable?
[1:41:46] <taken351> so many announcements at EVO
[1:41:48] <Reigner13> I think daigo will play honda too
[1:41:55] <megatonbeef> @domadormilagroso Damage and plus frames
[1:41:57] <Bushinbro> @VesperArcade try the medium dp after cr.lp instead of vskill
[1:41:57] <mrsolodolo456> whats her fastest button
[1:42:01] <crypticrumpet> Lucia literally sold me the least on her gameplay trailer. Is she fun?
[1:42:01] <snowfarmer81> head butt anti airs
[1:42:05] <LaLiLuLeLolz> her low forward is not cancelable
[1:42:06] <redpotato> looks like sakura normal
[1:42:08] <GetUpTo88> Does she have setup into the fireball and empty jump low?
[1:42:18] <Beats_By_Noel_Brown> Honda basically has Hugo meat squashed for VTrigger
[1:42:21] <DomadorMilagroso> @megatonbeef thanks. This 3 characters are the only announcement?
[1:42:22] <Cryojazz> somebody at capcom has a fetish for blonde chicks
[1:42:25] <crypticrumpet> I think she has 3f?
[1:42:26] <LaLiLuLeLolz> target combo?
[1:42:29] <Beats_By_Noel_Brown> Squasher**
[1:42:36] <megatonbeef> @domadormilagroso Yes till capcom Cup timen
[1:42:37] <ace_kings305> @beats_by_noel_brown Really ?
[1:42:37] <Magicjerryfresh11> Cr mk?
[1:42:37] <blankarolls> anyone else have trouble with some of hondas trials? lol
[1:42:46] <SquallAdv> chat, check "CapcomChannel" JP YouTube channel is you wanna listen the new char voices in japanese
[1:42:47] <TheProRookie56> cr mk xx dp
[1:42:52] <sonicsupremacy1> @vesperarcade was there a balance patch at all?
[1:42:59] <DomadorMilagroso> @megatonbeef thanks!!
[1:42:59] <someguy_zero> @Cryojazz Lucia best blond Kreygasm
[1:43:03] <shinzo1987> I think Lucia looks stiff because like the other final fight characters capcom are trying to emulate their styles from the games, even cody looks stiff and he is an established character
[1:43:09] <snowfarmer81> got Kens bounce
[1:43:14] <LaLiLuLeLolz> probably a hidden change or two here or there
[1:43:23] <Linkashbr> most bug fixes
[1:43:27] <NightmareJames> Just faced 2 Hondas in Casual Match at Gold
[1:43:27] <Linkashbr> no balance
[1:43:31] <that_japanese_dude> Lucia kinda looks like goose
[1:43:33] <ace_kings305> Nothing wrong with blonde white girls Kreygasm
[1:43:34] <sonicsupremacy1> Nash remains trash
[1:43:36] <TripleAAA995> Look at Lucia character demonstration for tips on her playstyle
[1:43:37] <Kibosh_Kaibutsu> no balance patch?
[1:43:39] <SlimCrim> Adding Ryu would be cool
[1:43:41] <bobdobbz> @vesperarcade did you see the new option in training mode?
[1:43:44] <sicayou> they'll probly wait till after capcom cup
[1:43:48] <ellisdraps> ranking? already?? sweet samson!
[1:43:49] <LaLiLuLeLolz> I fear balance patches because they might just randomly nerf Juri
[1:43:52] <Beats_By_Noel_Brown> Bug Fix : the character named fang has been removed
[1:43:53] <DomadorMilagroso> Karin and Akuma
[1:43:54] <snowfarmer81> Was Zeku army at evo
[1:43:54] <RoninWoof> was there ANY major SFV announcements?
[1:43:56] <Thedarkfenix0> Where's Ryu?
[1:43:58] <ensanesane> I thought it was zeku army
[1:44:05] <MetalxOath> New option in training mode? what is it?
[1:44:06] <Renevbz> her intro is so gay
[1:44:07] <SquallAdv> Yeah Juri will be nerfed for sure
[1:44:09] <Bou_Bof> Hi everybody, no season pass 2019? Just FM? 😰
[1:44:10] <Menat> when are they gonna add ed
[1:44:14] <megatonbeef> @thedarkfenix0 Left for smash
[1:44:15] <ace_kings305> @renevbz Lol why LUL ?
[1:44:16] <NinoDiablo> No balance patch?
[1:44:16] <serow081> the announcement was that there will be an announcement in nov/dec
[1:44:19] <8PoOryGone8> they just announced something for Nov and Dec and thats it
[1:44:19] <Chronodragon107> Karin Army rise LUL
[1:44:19] <crypticrumpet> TBH the game is in a good place balance wise
[1:44:32] <ellisdraps> Oh bronze life
[1:44:34] <SquallAdv> good balance, except Karin, delete Karin.
[1:44:36] <bobdobbz> You can make the dummy block high or low only @metalxoath
[1:44:49] <Cryojazz> everyone came through with the announcements but capcom NotLikeThis
[1:44:52] <sonicsupremacy1> @crypticrumpet it's okay, but low tiers are really hurting tbh
[1:44:53] <MetalxOath> @bobdobbz Oh sweet, thanks
[1:44:54] <crypticrumpet> Karin isn't even OP she's just incredibly solid
[1:44:55] <someguy_zero> I bet Phenom picked up Karin because he kept getting bodied by Punk. Punk scarred him for life
[1:44:55] <Kristoffers> you gone through lucia's story mode already vesper?
[1:44:55] <ensanesane> he just stood there lol
[1:45:00] <ace_kings305> Why does she talk like that where is she from
[1:45:02] <LaLiLuLeLolz> All I want for Juri is just FEW plus frames? Please?
[1:45:03] <snowfarmer81> Karin needs buffs. She actually requires slight execution.
[1:45:05] <Murkado> so boys where does Lucia fall on the SF5 Thiccness Tier List? 🤔
[1:45:06] <015kirb> I didn't watch Tekken 7 and smash Bros, was it hype?
[1:45:07] <SSJSoujiro> Stage looks great but does it do the thing at match end tho?
[1:45:07] <megatonbeef> Gave up
[1:45:07] <shredmaster96> he afk TPFufun TPFufun TPFufun
[1:45:08] <RoninWoof> They Announced there would be an announcement in Nov!? seriously!?!?
[1:45:09] <Thedarkfenix0> I see. Guess RIP for Ryu
[1:45:09] <shinzo1987> evo annoyed me when infexious went VT2 vs Big Bird and the james chen with the other guy couldn't understand why he would use it because its a bad VT, it was obvious it was there as a way to escape corner pressure opf rashid because it side swaps
[1:45:10] <TaskaNawa> lol
[1:45:12] <The_Enygma> technically, MK11 didn't have shit either
[1:45:12] <taken351> sunflower akuma :D
[1:45:17] <SSJSoujiro> haha it does! nice!
[1:45:17] <Renevbz> bet capcom wishes they stuck with ps4 steam ruined evo!!!
[1:45:23] <Hurked> Tekken was for sure
[1:45:28] <andynigma> im so mad about these chars and no balance patch actually capcom is the biggest loser in this EVO no hype at all
[1:45:28] <Yamsandjams> bulli
[1:45:28] <Kristoffers> baw
[1:45:31] <Pipiripau78> sup vesper greetings from houston..
[1:45:31] <GetUpTo88> @vesperarcade seems like you could do the ex fb and empty jump low?
[1:45:31] <TigerBloodBeast> He quit life half way through
[1:45:32] <SweetBabyBuddha> B U L L Y!
[1:45:32] <I_nod_my_head_when_I_lose> bully
[1:45:33] <Cryojazz> true but watching mk11 is an L in itself
[1:45:34] <rashidoo> "I was trying out the game cuz of the free trial, but thanks to vesper smurfing i know i wont be buying this shit"
[1:45:35] <Darnell16player> I would like to see Ryu, Ken and Sakura get some good buffs imo
[1:45:36] <fyz1x> EVO Top 8 was in fact Good Ass Tekken.
[1:45:38] <jimmylee1015> Smurf = bully
[1:45:39] <crypticrumpet> EVO announcements were definitely lackluster
[1:45:39] <enzo152> bullyarcade
[1:45:43] <gruff_gridof> hes been fighting smurfs all night give him a break man
[1:45:43] <shredmaster96> dude i like your stream so much wonder951ove wonder951ove wonder951ove wonder951ove wonder951ove wonder951ove
[1:45:46] <crypticrumpet> but the tourneys were great
[1:45:48] <taken351> how
[1:45:55] <Clinnamon> that akuma is uninstalling as we speak
[1:45:59] <megatonbeef> @roninwoof But the tank in blazeblue x bro
[1:46:00] <jimmylee1015> Facts
[1:46:11] <Beats_By_Noel_Brown> Damn dude was hype off evo and tried the trial now he’s uninstalling @vesperarcade bully
[1:46:11] <someguy_zero> Did you try the other V-Trigger?
[1:46:11] <bruthaboom> She has a link like ed in the corner with fireball
[1:46:16] <GoldCarats> This Character is soooo sick!!!
[1:46:17] <ZyxWhitewind> I missed all of SF but saw Tekken and samsho. SF top 8 any good?
[1:46:18] <Llesor> she looks like a character with options
[1:46:20] <donh98> what announcement got you the most hyped vesper?
[1:46:20] <Llesor> and that's great
[1:46:21] <that_japanese_dude> that awkward moment when Infiltration wins a tournament
[1:46:23] <AzureWotan> wait were actually playing sfv?????
[1:46:27] <andynigma> TEKKEN IS DOING SO MUCH BETTER!
[1:46:34] <Renpool> She has many weapons
[1:46:39] <SquallAdv> TEPPEN > TEKKEN
[1:46:39] <crypticrumpet> what the fuck is even Lucia's second VT? She just whaps you with the baton?
[1:46:40] <taken351> the announcements at EVO were great
[1:46:43] <ensanesane> her other vt seems like cody
[1:46:44] <almightygod4> Just tried her out she’s pretty clean

[1:47:37] <Renevbz> i will get back into this game if haggar is dlc
[1:47:37] <crypticrumpet> It would be cool if her VT2 functioned like Cody's VT1
[1:47:53] <awoo07> What are her anti airs??
[1:47:53] <MetalxOath> are their patch notes out? I know it was bug fixes and stuff but I still wanna see what changed
[1:47:54] <NaughtyJuri> I know but still I don't trust the trolling

[1:51:15] <DomadorMilagroso> KoF for ps4 or next gen?
[1:51:16] <almightygod4> @eltanin_z I think it would be a LoL fighter
[1:51:19] <AzureWotan> @vesperarcade appearently league fighting game was trademarked
[1:51:22] <thebananatreeboa> Oro won't be as cool without kuroda/unblockable setups :(
[1:51:26] <swiftruina> And it’s +3, right? RIP

[1:51:47] <LC_Spacely> @vesperarcade I don't see the bundles. is it because I'm on the west coast?
[1:51:47] <Cryojazz> why would ashe be a rushdown and not zoner NotLikeThis
[1:51:49] <the_mega_guy_> Robot characters?
[1:51:53] <ZyxWhitewind> bram is the grappler
[1:52:00] <drarkain> @VesperArcade i remember a fucking long time ago we talked about it, i have an feeling that they will make an Smash style FG...
[1:52:00] <leafretv> rushdown with a bow LUL
[1:52:01] <Kibosh_Kaibutsu> probably do stun combos with tth fireball
[1:52:02] <SSJSoujiro> Make new characters LuL no no no better use assist's that they have already imo
[1:52:03] <crypticrumpet> Does Lucia have a 3f or 4f?

[1:52:10] <ensanesane> damn that slide is fast
[1:52:10] <almightygod4> Blizcrack would be a robot fighter LUL
[1:52:10] <Eltanin_Z> almightygod4 personally I hope that's the case, I really like LoL characters but I could never dig the game itself
[1:52:11] <serow081> KOF probably for both...? their financial report said they are planning for 2020 release
[1:52:13] <kumaoso024> hahahah
[1:52:13] <8PoOryGone8> that fireball lmao
[1:52:15] <taken351> XD
[1:52:16] <battleb0rn> depends on the characters
[1:52:16] <someguy_zero> Anyone know why this stage is BANNED in tourneys nowadays?
[1:52:17] <micksinjer911> it reminds me of laura standing med kick from season 2
[1:52:17] <leafretv> Master Yi in a fighting game would be monkaS
[1:52:20] <phenrixx> Wtf
[1:52:21] <Thedarkfenix0> noooo RYU feelsbadman
[1:52:21] <ShinobiAJ> thats why this guy is in rookie
[1:52:22] <SweetBabyBuddha> ran him into it PogChamp
[1:52:23] <deala114> Lmao
[1:52:25] <battleb0rn> Yasuo would fit into a fighting game
[1:52:26] <Eltanin_Z> LUL
[1:52:26] <andalaaa> Am I still black listed vesper
[1:52:26] <ShinobiAJ> its cuz he plays ryu
[1:52:29] <DomadorMilagroso> @megatonbeef sorry for asking too much. I miss Evo for studying
[1:52:29] <topgunLT1> :(
[1:52:30] <ZyxWhitewind> they have plenty of characters to adapt to fighting game archetypes.
[1:52:30] <efmaniac_jp> that throw just matched
[1:52:32] <Hulkbusterv3> Poor Ryu
[1:52:32] <battleb0rn> Aatrox would
[1:52:33] <serow081> @someguy_zero coz this stage is too boring
[1:52:34] <megatonbeef> That was so Jank
[1:52:35] <horseapples> @someguy_zero doesn't make a good spectating experience
[1:52:36] <RoninWoof> CAUSE THIS STAGE SUCKS
[1:52:36] <SSJSoujiro> poor Ryu, payback for being good in SF4
[1:52:38] <battleb0rn> some others wouldnt
[1:52:39] <andynigma> and ken to @VesperArcade hahaha thas crazy bro
[1:52:40] <ShinobiAJ> a-atrox
[1:52:41] <Totay> as a ryu player it kills me
[1:52:42] <Omegafighter0> is this character good
[1:52:42] <gruff_gridof> feelsryuman
[1:52:45] <theMrHeadache> Whoa, her stand HP is only -2
[1:52:46] <Chronodragon107> Ryu will never be good in SFV LUL
[1:52:47] <Linkashbr> It can be a 1 button specials game guys, calm down with the hype.
[1:52:49] <ShinobiAJ> try that on my graves
[1:52:56] <ghostfrom3rdstrike> mmo dev team working on a fighting game is cool because they know how to make each character different and stand out with tons of personality
[1:52:58] <JAR2388_> Hope to see Sodom Oro and C.Viper , Ryu is just a lost cause LUL
[1:52:59] <DomadorMilagroso> Make Ryu great again
[1:53:05] <RedHotJoe> Vi
[1:53:06] <Darnell16player> ryu and ken get all the flak for no reason @VesperArcade
[1:53:07] <battleb0rn> i just cant picture moba players caring about a fighting game
[1:53:09] <ghostfrom3rdstrike> Similar to like Blizzard making a fighting game
[1:53:13] <bobdobbz> @rashidoo have you seen Honda’s butt slap animation and sound after st Fierce?
[1:53:15] <MosesTheChosenOne> SF4 Ryu as guest character
[1:53:16] <ghostfrom3rdstrike> Moba*
[1:53:18] <ghostfrom3rdstrike> Sorry
[1:53:19] <NaughtyJuri> New guilty gear looks to have DOA stage interaction to the next stage when falling off the Current one
[1:53:21] <sacredsilence67> im a pad player just coming back to the game any suggestions for a main?
[1:53:25] <TigerBloodBeast> @vesper Are you going to test out the other characters tonight?
[1:53:26] <horseapples> could you imagine a blizzard fighting game, they'd give all the moves cooldown
[1:53:26] <topgunLT1> they need to add a gem system in sf5 that would modify projectile behavior
[1:53:36] <8PoOryGone8> soo specials will have cooldowns
[1:53:37] <LaughsWithKnives> ive got 7k hours in dota, i care about leagues fighting game
[1:53:37] <serow081> reminds me of K's ein trigger
[1:53:38] <ghostfrom3rdstrike> Gems ghostf16Thinking
[1:53:41] <crypticrumpet> @topgunLT1 please no gems
[1:53:41] <SweetBabyBuddha> ryu has a tatsu though
[1:53:44] <leafretv> Its funny cause some of the most popular league champions are the ones with super high skill caps. So it wouldn't be surprising if they gravitate to a fighting game
[1:53:45] <serow081> i loved that skill and its followups
[1:53:46] <shinzo1987> @battleb0rn Dyrus has been getting really into fighting games
[1:53:46] <Thedarkfenix0> Man, Ryu has just been dumped on once again
[1:53:47] <ensanesane> rip
[1:53:47] <Clinnamon> FeelsRyuMan
[1:53:48] <afroshouji> "Why don't my fireballs act like pinballs?"
[1:53:52] <leafretv> like yasuo/riven are some of the most popular characters in league
[1:53:53] <NightmareJames> I wouldn't trust Riot making a fighting game
[1:53:53] <JAR2388_> New GG TBH ResidentSleeper
[1:53:53] <NaughtyJuri> No Gems please that’s how SFXTK died
[1:53:54] <ShinobiAJ> ah yes tatsu the best move in the game
[1:53:54] <SSJSoujiro> LuL
[1:53:55] <valerio123br> lucia soccer player?
[1:53:58] <SSJSoujiro> Poor Ryu
[1:53:59] <ghostfrom3rdstrike> After SFxT I'm good off Gens ghostf16Thinking
[1:54:00] <Darnell16player> lab it?
[1:54:04] <Chronodragon107> Ryu getting bullied 4Head
[1:54:04] <Vampirekoala1> bully BibleThump
[1:54:08] <slooowdown> does the fireball build meter crazy like k'
[1:54:12] <RorBoy> She's a cawp
[1:54:15] <Kibosh_Kaibutsu> https://clips.twitch.tv/SleepyBumblingNoodleDogFace
[1:54:15] <drarkain> @battleb0rn yeah, most of my friends that play moba, only like Smash , the other FG they play mashing really hard haha
[1:54:16] <crypticrumpet> oh does she get like a cooldown on her fireball?
[1:54:22] <someguy_zero> I'd like to see how the fireball work against Sagat's fireball
[1:54:23] <josdean22> Lucia fireball reminds me rashid's bullshit tornado
[1:54:26] <BlackCraftFGC> how can I get more fight money?
[1:54:27] <bobdobbz> From Bawston
[1:54:36] <bobdobbz> I love her accent
[1:54:37] <CountMeowingtonn> i like how she tries to put the fire out on her foot after using fireballs
[1:54:37] <afroshouji> And she has a good Tatsu.
[1:54:42] <battleb0rn> theres lots of us who play mobas and fighting games, but in general ? I doubt they care about them unless its Smash
[1:54:42] <015kirb> riot game gonna have one for normals, then 2 buttons for special moves, then one button for super move
[1:54:43] <daMuffinMan007> leave this poor child alone Vesper LUL

[1:55:24] <Thiir> what is ur favorite icecream flavor?
[1:55:27] <JAR2388_> SFV needs more blondes Kappa
[1:55:28] <Darnell16player> so lucia's fb against a tatsu we need to lab
[1:55:28] <leafretv> story mode doesn't give fight money anymore
[1:55:33] <Alpha_Bee> lucia is basically swaggy Ken

[1:55:59] <8PoOryGone8> @ProT0Hype same, she reminded me of viper somehow
[1:56:01] <Thedarkfenix0> When they tried to make a good Ryu, it just ended up being worse. Thanks, Kage, very cool!
[1:56:04] <ghostfrom3rdstrike> That fuckin sucks
[1:56:12] <enzo152> vesperCoffee

[2:01:00] <The_Enygma> be like WHO ARE YOU PEOPLE
[2:01:03] <the_mega_guy_> I saw Poongko got blown out in pools
[2:01:03] <Hulkbusterv3> Most of the top guys got blown up in the top 64
[2:01:07] <megatonbeef> @st1ckyrick Even the announcers where worried he’d fall over
[2:01:13] <JAR2388_> And Okubo parrying the SNK dude was LUL
[2:01:13] <ninjavanish> I loved SFV EVO this year
[2:01:14] <ol_haba> @VesperArcade i think that's wrong, i think it's mad easy to be consistent in sfv, it's just hard to place high in tournies consistently, there's too many killers now
[2:01:15] <nevernude_> DBZ was the best Grand finals
[2:01:16] <bellfym> I thought BigBird would win
[2:01:17] <ustinodj> nice jump in vesperCoffee
[2:01:20] <HeavenIy_Demon> problem eliminated punk
[2:01:22] <Kibosh_Kaibutsu> am seeing a dalsim fireball , slide before it lands thing with her
[2:01:22] <Hartisas> Vesper looks like he's having fun with Lucia PogChamp
[2:01:24] <schmalthoff> Problem X eliminated Punk
[2:01:32] <IGrimNinja> So @vesperarcade when you gonna switch to Hitbox and be a true sagar main like zaf and automatt?
[2:01:32] <Moobot> Join the Vesper Arcade Discord at https://discord.gg/esjX5km
[2:01:35] <Curseshadowx> Did rising thunder sell well?
[2:01:35] <015kirb> redownloaded sfv on steam, dlc still not showing up, feelsbadman BibleThump
[2:01:37] <ghostfrom3rdstrike> Alot of the best guys in all main stage games got blown up this year
[2:01:41] <IGrimNinja> Sagat*
[2:01:47] <NightmareJames> SFV had a hype Grand Finals this year, Tekken was trash
[2:01:47] <paulstar107> I’m so glad Bonchan won he deserved it
[2:01:50] <ghostfrom3rdstrike> Most of the Americans in Dbfz got knocked out early
[2:01:54] <ol_haba> If everyone is top 8 material, 4001 people are gonna get their feelings hurt
[2:02:04] <glovecold> Bonchan picking the King Sagat was so hype for me. That was awesome
[2:02:06] <GoldCarats> Yeah Bonchan definitely deserved it
[2:02:07] <someguy_zero> Bonchan's gotta be top 3 in points now, no?
[2:02:11] <battleb0rn> yea the tekken final wasnt nearly as epic as bonchans last round
[2:02:12] <ustinodj> Is this one of the new chars?
[2:02:12] <that_japanese_dude> Daigo had a cold tho
[2:02:15] <RorBoy> Switchbox is the future
[2:02:16] <Cryojazz> sfv is too volatile to place consistently
[2:02:22] <that_japanese_dude> why do you hate Daigo?
[2:02:23] <RagingMarmot> yeah Daigo had a cold
[2:02:23] <battleb0rn> that lame ass kazumi slapping
[2:02:25] <SsHomes> tekken grand finals kazumi was whack. definitely expected more
[2:02:26] <Solideva> @VesperArcade when are you going wash Daigo's hitbox?
[2:02:27] <bobdobbz> Yea but it’s fun
[2:02:33] <megatonbeef> Are you still upset Bonchan used ultra 2 against luffe
[2:02:34] <RoninWoof> @vesperarcade Me watching the Guilty Gear trailer: OMG! Black guy in fighting game, not a Boxer, and is a Samurai Mecha!!!! KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype BlessRNG
[2:02:35] <rashidoo> falke this character
[2:02:36] <Startropics> was there any balance changes or just the 3 new characters?
[2:02:39] <8PoOryGone8> KNEE turout to be the underdog
[2:02:40] <thablackoshin> Wait Lucia can kick her fireball with tatsu???
[2:02:40] <Anon9504> tekken was sick
[2:02:41] <MetalxOath> A FALKE PLAYER!??! You mean I'm not the only one :0
[2:02:43] <96kfigueroa> I’m getting the crosupp stick that hitbox is making
[2:02:45] <actioncomics1000> mk11 top 8 was horrible.
[2:02:48] <serow081> it's still better than kof14 turning into a 2v2 game
[2:02:50] <GoldCarats> Karin is just too strong lol lmao
[2:02:54] <sonicnerd14> Knee fanboys are mad I guess LUL
[2:02:55] <YomoTheWanderer> I'm facing the Lucia you just beat lol
[2:02:57] <TheLastChrono> What was Tekkens viewer count?
[2:03:00] <nevernude_> whats this switchbox you people are talking about.
[2:03:01] <bobdobbz> I love my wooden Hitbox
[2:03:06] <I_nod_my_head_when_I_lose> mk needs a patch now
[2:03:10] <Cryojazz> aslan ash said he's not even the best player where he's from LUL
[2:03:12] <someguy_zero> This other character's name
[2:03:13] <AzureWotan> smash top 8 fucking sucked
[2:03:16] <Leoguimaraes89> they need to buff geras
[2:03:18] <nevernude_> I hate the Lows in MK, They look silly
[2:03:19] <battleb0rn> this guy loves women
[2:03:20] <RorBoy> Switchbox is an arcade stick and a hitbox together
[2:03:20] <NightmareJames> Tekken was the worst top 8
[2:03:22] <ghostfrom3rdstrike> I actually didn't watch MK top 8, and that's my main game right now LUL
[2:03:24] <battleb0rn> look at hiis name
[2:03:24] <glovecold> Kazumi was pretty good. She had insane normals. That guy was unstoppable.
[2:03:28] <sonicnerd14> @TheLastChrono About 200K
[2:03:33] <GoldCarats> Karin should be nerfed nah just kidding
[2:03:36] <that_japanese_dude> TOLDYA
[2:03:38] <Kibosh_Kaibutsu> she have dp?
[2:03:39] <TheLastChrono> Damn
[2:03:41] <8PoOryGone8> @AzureWotan did they announce anything after smash?
[2:03:43] <ghostfrom3rdstrike> Tekken worst top 8?! What top 8 was you watching? LUL LUL
[2:03:44] <96kfigueroa> Mk11 is so boring to watch, but dragon ball was 🔥
[2:03:48] <SsHomes> i really dont like the look of blockstrings in mk
[2:03:48] <Darnell16player> yeah evo is done
[2:03:48] <someguy_zero> Evo was done before smash LUL
[2:03:49] <theMrHeadache> Nah its donezo
[2:03:49] <Cryojazz> who watched smash?
[2:03:52] <battleb0rn> EVO was over after Tekken
[2:03:52] <AzureWotan> no announcements for smash
[2:03:52] <taken351> EVO is done
[2:03:57] <Euury> dbfz was hype as fuck sadly it was on saturday
[2:03:58] <MetalxOath> Poor Falke, the only character left that doesn't function properly
[2:03:59] <tokenblackdood> 270k for Smash
[2:03:59] <max_do_em> Sup @VesperArcade MK11 needs more grabs
[2:04:02] <taken351> haha XD
[2:04:02] <luvmastahchris> Smash was sick
[2:04:04] <I_nod_my_head_when_I_lose> mk was the same 4 tippy top tiers every match, it was snooze
[2:04:05] <sonicnerd14> @ghostfrom3rdstrike I know right Lol
[2:04:07] <SsHomes> james chen telling people to stay was whack
[2:04:07] <96kfigueroa> Smash finals was lit too
[2:04:11] <AzureWotan> smash was such a disappointment
[2:04:12] <I_nod_my_head_when_I_lose> So sick of geras
[2:04:14] <bobdobbz> Dragonball was sick. GO1 just broke down into tears
[2:04:15] <8PoOryGone8> smash got the highest views
[2:04:15] <someguy_zero> The bald guy already gave the post-game speech. Smash was just like aftershow Kappa
[2:04:16] <serow081> kof top 4 was quite exciting especially when ET used clark
[2:04:17] <ghostfrom3rdstrike> Yeah Evo Ended hours ago Vesper, Tekken Gf
[2:04:17] <NightmareJames> Tekken top 8 was an Arslan Ash combo video
[2:04:20] <SquallAdv> MK LUL
[2:04:26] <Anon9504> lucia v gauge build seems nice
[2:04:27] <swiftruina> And everyone says MK11 is the most balanced NRS game on launch.
[2:04:28] <t_dark0wl> Are the character passes out, or do I have to buy each character separate
[2:04:34] <actioncomics1000> dbfz top 8 was godlike. And i dont usually watch tournaments for that game.
[2:04:35] <CountMeowingtonn> but vesper, why would mk11 need balance patches when you can just watch people get ripped in half Kappa
[2:04:36] <TheMegamansam> Only watched Tekken top 8 cause of the guy from Pakistan
[2:04:37] <Darnell16player> 225K tekken had as a high. 200K for sfv and 100k for dbfz in terms of views. smash had 230k last i saw
[2:04:37] <megatonbeef> Gears so boring
[2:04:38] <96kfigueroa> Smash wasn’t a disappointment lol, it was fun to watch
[2:04:42] <serow081> character bundle is out on steam
[2:04:48] <PeepCan> where is Riot's fighting game? i thought they're gonna reveal it
[2:04:50] <ghostfrom3rdstrike> Cetrion ResidentSleeper
[2:04:52] <t_dark0wl> not on PS4?
[2:04:55] <aaron87> this guy loves women ladies and gentleman. and he wants the world to know.
[2:04:55] <RagingMarmot> Cetrion vs Cassie sums up MK
[2:04:57] <someguy_zero> Tekken was the hardest to watch
[2:04:58] <MosesTheChosenOne> @t_dark0wl Steam, EU and AUS PSN have the bundle
[2:04:59] <bananeeFTW> serow081 how much is it?
[2:05:00] <RealTIER> @darnell16player Dbfz passed 200k
[2:05:03] <81chilly> How much or just fight money chars?
[2:05:03] <SsHomes> cassie ResidentSleeper
[2:05:05] <supremecoy> I loved MK11 top 8, outside 2 geras all were diferent characters
[2:05:06] <MosesTheChosenOne> NA still left behind
[2:05:07] <96kfigueroa> CEnTrIon.... I hate that character
[2:05:08] <nevernude_> Tekkens viewer count was insane
[2:05:08] <ghostfrom3rdstrike> Tekken was Hype Asf
[2:05:10] <serow081> 15usd i think
[2:05:11] <bustarwolf> MK is balanced because both opponents will fall asleep before the end of the match
[2:05:12] <tomfromtheclouds> Good morning @vesperarcade and chat! FutureMan Had a nice weekend?
[2:05:15] <GoldCarats> Is it safe to say Queen Karin is the best in the game or nah?
[2:05:16] <JAR2388_> GERAS AND SONYA are fucking TRASHHHHH
[2:05:16] <t_dark0wl> boo
[2:05:16] <SSJSoujiro> MK 11 was garbage everything else was super sick tho
[2:05:18] <Bing_Bing_Wahoo> Samsho and DBFZ GF were the best ones for me FUNgineer
[2:05:19] <glovecold> Cetrion is a fucking injustice character
[2:05:20] <Eltanin_Z> I felt ending Evo with Smash felt a bit anti-climatic
[2:05:23] <cool_vargas> mk tournaments being 3 out of 5 the entire way, is wack
[2:05:25] <battleb0rn> yea that kazumi was boring as hell. How bad is it when a Karin player is exciting
[2:05:29] <Euury> @RealTIER dbfz was 102k peak on twitch
[2:05:31] <actioncomics1000> tekken top 8 was godlike.
[2:05:34] <ghostfrom3rdstrike> Jar and his hot takes ghostf16Thinking
[2:05:35] <Darnell16player> @RealTIER like i said it was from what i saw at the same time so it could have changed
[2:05:37] <96kfigueroa> Dbfz was hype.
[2:05:37] <t_dark0wl> How good is Lucia's range?
[2:05:40] <freakyyyy8> ahha
[2:05:42] <96kfigueroa> Tekken too
[2:05:45] <t_dark0wl> She stubby?
[2:05:46] <nevernude_> @Bing_Bing_Wahoo I feel the same way
[2:05:47] <NightmareJames> Are we allowed to mention Infiltration in here @vesperarcade ?
[2:05:48] <LaughsWithKnives> mk is balanced cuz everyone can mash d1 into 1111111 corner kb combo
[2:05:51] <battleb0rn> only reason the tekken final was any good was because of Knee
[2:05:55] <Cryojazz> fighterz was sleeper outside of winner finals and grand finals
[2:05:58] <96kfigueroa> Mk11 is just not hype like mkX
[2:06:03] <Emp_cannedpasta> So what’s lookin optimal after ex run charge
[2:06:05] <SSJSoujiro> YUCK
[2:06:07] <SquallAdv> his name account <3
[2:06:12] <serow081> samsho top 8 was maybe 50% genjuro LOL
[2:06:14] <drarkain> @Eltanin_Z for me to, mainly because the guy that won had no emotions...
[2:06:17] <lxgreed05> MK has always been boring never was hype
[2:06:17] <Renevbz> honda v trigger 2 is so funny lmfao
[2:06:19] <RorBoy> Mk11 needs to make so many variation moves just regular ones
[2:06:19] <glovecold> lol
[2:06:21] <someguy_zero> MK dead game by end of the year Kappa
[2:06:23] <SSJSoujiro> Pick them top tiers to win so can't really hate LuL
[2:06:23] <JAR2388_> @ghostfrom3rdstrike Hi dude LUL
[2:06:24] <swiftruina> Like 1/3 of the cast was not used
[2:06:29] <RealTIER> @euury I was literally in the chat, it well passed 200k mainly during Winners Finals
[2:06:32] <that_japanese_dude> Poison is pretty fun
[2:06:41] <8PoOryGone8> Smash is really not sponsored by Nintendo, they already have nintendo direct for announcement
[2:06:45] <96kfigueroa> And they are taking sooo long to release doc characters
[2:06:48] <actioncomics1000> samurai shodown was pretty good 2. Snk is just giving away free characters lol.
[2:06:50] <ghostfrom3rdstrike> reoFeels
[2:07:02] <96kfigueroa> Dlc*
[2:07:04] <ghostfrom3rdstrike> Samsho had 4 Genjuros in top 8 LUL LUL
[2:07:05] <I_nod_my_head_when_I_lose> I was expecting notes by now but nothing, if nothing happens by night wolf that game is rip
[2:07:05] <aqua_snake> Thats always been the case witrh MK, they dont prioritize balance first
[2:07:15] <GoldCarats> IT definitely needs a balance patch bad
[2:07:16] <Hulkbusterv3> They're working on a new injustice right now.
[2:07:17] <serow081> yeah man samsho lol
[2:07:18] <lxgreed05> MK had the lowest viewership outta the 9 games
[2:07:20] <bustarwolf> NRS spends 90% of development on the Storymode, 10% on the gameplay. And why not, shit sells like hotcakes then they make the next one
[2:07:22] <megatonbeef> @actioncomics1000 Final 8 looked like mid 2000s
[2:07:25] <ghostfrom3rdstrike> NRS has a rep for nerfng characters into OBLIVION
[2:07:25] <Solideva> in sfv's case they had a lot of diversity in characters for top 8 @VesperArcade
[2:07:26] <RealTIER> I’m probably only getting Lucy
[2:07:27] <vegabuster18> I hate it when Fighting Game Devs simplify there fighting games too much just make the game have options for each character and crazy combos
[2:07:28] <TheLastChrono> Yeah its been over 3 months
[2:07:36] <aitch2o> Yo, what's really good, Vesp? I see you're playing the worst out of the 3 (IYO). How you like her?
[2:07:36] <TheMegamansam> Im having too much fun with Honda’s vt2
[2:07:40] <that_japanese_dude> poison
[2:07:40] <Sandman444a> LUL
[2:07:42] <someguy_zero> Kreygasm
[2:07:44] <Clinnamon> poison Kreygasm
[2:07:45] <jimmylee1015> poison... is that a dude?
[2:07:46] <SquallAdv> Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm doodMako
[2:07:48] <I_nod_my_head_when_I_lose> they need to just get rid of variations
[2:07:50] <millselonius> NRS usually patches their games too much
[2:07:51] <SSJSoujiro> ooh yeah fuck MK11 for not being to use all the varations
[2:07:51] <NaughtyJuri> MK11 went overbroad realistic graphics and fatalities some of them are way too damn long
[2:07:52] <8PoOryGone8> that Poison looks Kreygasm
[2:07:53] <Teep0> sutoGASM
[2:07:54] <glovecold> Mk prioritize graphical fidelity first. Oh and dlc.
[2:07:56] <PeepCan> Kreygasm
[2:07:59] <Euury> @RealTIER i was watching too and i'm quite sure it peaked at 102k , it was also during league LCS which had around 100k as well
[2:08:04] <B1ggRandall> Yea we need more variations
[2:08:05] <RedHotJoe> Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[2:08:05] <megatonbeef> @jimmylee1015 Don’t ask don’t tell
[2:08:07] <someguy_zero> Smurf watch out
[2:08:10] <swiftruina> Just let people pick their moves.
[2:08:12] <GoldCarats> Mk is definitely a sick game though no matter what
[2:08:13] <QarteX_> hi man,new characters good?
[2:08:13] <ZyxWhitewind> just her smile
[2:08:13] <ghostfrom3rdstrike> So.... Poison is a male right?
[2:08:13] <Kibosh_Kaibutsu> only the end win screen
[2:08:16] <MetalxOath> @VesperArcade I just don't like Poison lol
[2:08:16] <JAR2388_> KappaPride KappaPride KappaPride KappaPride KappaPride
[2:08:16] <MosesTheChosenOne> this poison omg
[2:08:20] <Renevbz> he is ugly
[2:08:20] <jimmylee1015> It's not that we dont like it... It's just... makes me question...
[2:08:20] <Clinnamon> it's only a couple spots where it looks weird
[2:08:20] <Darnell16player> i didn't like poison's face
[2:08:21] <RagingMarmot> if they are going to leave a game that unbalanced just drop the tournament variations
[2:08:21] <ayyylma093> she only looks bad in win pose
[2:08:21] <Eltanin_Z> the quality on these 3 new character's models is pretty sick
[2:08:23] <8PoOryGone8> Poison on char screen is good
[2:08:25] <Teh_Wrecker> just make sure she doesnt win
[2:08:29] <actioncomics1000> dude even bbtag was better than mk11.
[2:08:31] <that_japanese_dude> that's great
[2:08:32] <daMuffinMan007> would still smash Kappa
[2:08:33] <0mpah> @ghostfrom3rdstrike back then yeah
[2:08:38] <JAR2388_> Nightwolf design is whack , that helmet is awful
[2:08:39] <SquallAdv> nee? TehePelo
[2:08:42] <ninjavanish> poisons face looks fine
[2:08:43] <B1ggRandall> Hey does Honda stage comes with the pack?
[2:08:44] <SSJSoujiro> No fireball poison lets go!
[2:08:45] <Startropics> is poison sfw for esports? XD
[2:08:46] <Darnell16player> bbtag was fun. And i am unsure of getting the game
[2:08:47] <ghostfrom3rdstrike> @0mpah so..... yes?
[2:08:48] <megatonbeef> @actioncomics1000 They giving us a tank
[2:08:53] <TheMegamansam> The win face looks like the wicked witch from the west
[2:08:56] <NaughtyJuri> God bless Capcom japan Fan Service <3
[2:08:56] <Eltanin_Z> makes me wish they redid or at least touched up a little bit some the original characters
[2:09:00] <Cryojazz> nostalgia poison PogChamp
[2:09:03] <Darnell16player> @daMuffinMan007 would pull you away from a trap
[2:09:05] <RoninWoof> i see nothing wrong with Poisons face
[2:09:06] <actioncomics1000> that tank looked hype as fuck.
[2:09:09] <Kristoffers> that poison is camo colored
[2:09:13] <glovecold> Soul calibur was pretty great
[2:09:15] <NinoDiablo> Poison's face is done well. Just that one smile pose on the win screen. So of like Ibuki's weird smile
[2:09:18] <0mpah> @ghostfrom3rdstrike no she's a female I looked it up lmao
[2:09:19] <daMuffinMan007> @Darnell16player i would need to confirm of course LUL
[2:09:20] <SSJSoujiro> LuL fucking FACTS @TheMegamansam
[2:09:20] <AdmiralAckbars_Snackbar> dammit lucia is a better zonerr then most zoners in this game LUL
[2:09:23] <B1ggRandall> No fireball for poison ???
[2:09:28] <someguy_zero> She had the whip command grab VT
[2:09:33] <jimmylee1015> good question.. did she lose her fireball?
[2:09:35] <Darnell16player> @daMuffinMan007 oh god literal facepalm
[2:09:36] <mr__lawyer> @NinoDiablo and kolin is ugly as fuck

[2:10:04] <glovecold> It should’ve been Rose over poison.
[2:10:09] <mr__lawyer> @ustinodj facts
[2:10:10] <aitch2o> So, how did you like her so far, vesp? I know that's a faq, but I just got here.
[2:10:11] <ghostfrom3rdstrike> doodCap doodButt
[2:10:14] <jimmylee1015> LUL
[2:10:18] <RorBoy> Should have been Roxy
[2:10:23] <Hulkbusterv3> Dude just wants spidey swing man
[2:10:23] <bobdobbz> You can hit her before she gets there otherwise it’s real
[2:10:24] <PaulowebTV> wow I found Poison actually pretty difficult to play!
[2:10:26] <Cryojazz> @glovecold rose over lucia easy
[2:10:26] <AzureWotan> capcomMenatQQ
[2:10:27] <Legnowe> think you can jab during the swing. They showed that in the showcase
[2:10:28] <MetalxOath> How Poison was chosen over Makoto I will never understand
[2:10:31] <SquallAdv> Roxy confirmed
[2:10:34] <that_japanese_dude> HIIIIIIIII
[2:10:34] <96kfigueroa> Does anyone here own a hitbox? I have a question
[2:10:39] <Solideva> Poison looks worse in the trailer than in game its weird. Almost like they used an old not as polished model @VesperArcade
[2:10:43] <bobdobbz> I do
[2:10:44] <I_nod_my_head_when_I_lose> makoto fans mad LUL
[2:10:45] <RoninWoof> @vesperarcade Is Poison the only Trans character in fighting games?
[2:10:46] <PaulowebTV> definitely will take some time to get used to her stuff
[2:10:48] <aitch2o> Damn, that back throw doe
[2:10:51] <tomfromtheclouds> Poison's hair on her normal costume isn't great. She looks like Sakura's lame Roll costume... ResidentSleeper The one with the dress looks the best, or Nostalgia at least.
[2:10:57] <RorBoy> Bridget is trans
[2:10:57] <ghostfrom3rdstrike> I Hope C Viper is next
[2:10:57] <NinoDiablo> @mr__lawyer yeah, I don't like Kolin's face too. I prefer her old face in the Story mode
[2:10:58] <Yamsandjams> she got Falke hurtboses
[2:11:01] <8PoOryGone8> another Menat tier
[2:11:03] <Yamsandjams> hurtboxes*
[2:11:05] <Hulkbusterv3> She's another Menat
[2:11:06] <someguy_zero> @RoninWoof Poison is bonified female
[2:11:07] <glovecold> Makoto is last batch of character pass. I think.
[2:11:11] <ustinodj> @Yamsandjams are you serious vesperSad
[2:11:13] <Friendly59rus> @MetalxOath I think the same, but with Lucia
[2:11:16] <supremecoy> IMO in mk11 you really feel a diference and big gap between playing against intermediates/advanced/pros, like it really feels you cant beat somebody better than you :)
[2:11:17] <Kristoffers> is lucia fun?
[2:11:17] <Yamsandjams> @ustinodj check discord
[2:11:18] <megatonbeef> @roninwoof Voldo
[2:11:22] <ninjavanish> her whip cancel is going to take some time to get use to
[2:11:23] <Shadowdragon899> Hows Honda?
[2:11:23] <SSJSoujiro> True @tomfromtheclouds the dress outfits has the best hair
[2:11:27] <Eltanin_Z> Solideva yeah I noticed that too, she looks pretty sick in game right now

[2:11:58] <NYCness> high low mixups
[2:12:01] <PaulowebTV> that cancels, spacement with her vskill, juggles, a lot of stuff to study
[2:12:07] <B1ggRandall> @vesperarcade does the Honda stage comes with the pack?
[2:12:08] <RealTIER> Her fireball is actually very similar to SFIV Omega Ken right?
[2:12:09] <aitch2o> Yeah, they seem like a better version of sim's fireballs
[2:12:10] <Kristoffers> I like how energetic her animations are
[2:12:11] <ghostfrom3rdstrike> Imagine if Snake tease was real reoFeels
[2:12:13] <RorBoy> First you gotta respect da lawr
[2:12:16] <Solideva> @SSJSoujiro i thought she looked bad but having her in front of me in game changed my mind
[2:12:23] <LotoBlancoCL> @PaulowebTV lauriña maliña como estas
[2:12:24] <MetalxOath> @Friendly59rus Lucia is the 'New' character that I expected to have, but when bringing back old characters prioritizing popular ones should be key, and Makoto is the most popular one that's not in yet
[2:12:28] <LotoBlancoCL> hi @VesperArcade
[2:12:30] <Rainbowsunderthemoon> the akuma demon flip of fireballs
[2:12:34] <8PoOryGone8> snake on T7 would have been the best announcement this EVO

[2:13:22] <Darnell16player> poor ryu and shotos. What did shotos do to piss off people?
[2:13:23] <cool_vargas> is she better than kage? MiniK
[2:13:25] <The_Enygma> The answer lies in the heart of nerfs
[2:13:26] <8PoOryGone8> Daigo even said fireball is non existent in SF5
[2:13:27] <Hulkbusterv3> They're saving Makoto for last. She's super popular and they know she'll sell.
[2:13:27] <Yamsandjams> Juri's frieball cancel via kick sucks ass

[2:14:04] <LAVerde13> she reminds me too much of sakura in some ways
[2:14:12] <glovecold> Lucia might be our last new character. Should be oro, guy, Makoto, & Rose left.
[2:14:14] <Shadowdragon899> So Juri's move but better. Ouch
[2:14:16] <SquallAdv> I think there's a lot of Honda fans out there

[2:16:48] <Gyari> Right next to kage
[2:16:54] <TheMegamansam> You gotta be able to best Ryu to even get on the tier list
[2:16:54] <LAVerde13> Ryu = Secret Tier
[2:16:55] <glovecold> Remember when ken used to be good in the beta.
[2:16:56] <actioncomics1000> Yo is it just me or is snk working overtime with samsho they basically gave away 5 free dlc characters.
[2:16:57] <MetalxOath> Hey at least Ryu is still better then Falke
[2:17:02] <Hulkbusterv3> Honda gonna fuck Karin
[2:17:03] <bobdobbz> @96kfigueroa it’s good. It’s nothing fancy though. Just basic (the normal one) I will say I was bothered there’s no place to rest the palm of my hands tho at first.
[2:17:07] <8PoOryGone8> Lucia can since she has 3f
[2:17:09] <Darnell16player> @glovecold yeah for one season until people bitched

[2:17:27] <daMuffinMan007> no Akumas in top 8 was weird
[2:17:29] <megatonbeef> @robzoobie Only minor bug fixes
[2:17:30] <Hayate3S> 3f and an EX reversal is really important
[2:17:34] <supremecoy> Probably for general public appeal NRS should develop characters that are GOOD against ZONING..I agree dragon CETRION is not promotingt mk11 in "good way" even he play very strongly close combat frame traps
[2:17:38] <mr__lawyer> @RealTIER it does make sense

[2:42:00] <Beats_By_Noel_Brown> Canadian Honda
[2:42:01] <AmineFifty> when's Poison?
[2:42:11] <GeneiYun> Honda is the better Blanka
[2:42:11] <swiftruina> It sounds like he says “I’ll fuck you up” when he pops VT
[2:42:20] <ZyxWhitewind> turtle behind a shield behind a wall...
[2:42:29] <megatonbeef> Honda best grappler for sure
[2:42:32] <nahuelpv> until oro comes out Keepo
[2:42:32] <sidebysidefgc> its okay, Poison has so much depth
[2:42:33] <Beats_By_Noel_Brown> I feel like this costume redesign is inferior to classic honda, whyd they even bother lol
[2:42:35] <Kibosh_Kaibutsu> so we get these chrs to diamond?
[2:42:35] <Hartisas> What's in November?

[2:43:12] <nahuelpv> top tier honda is the worst timeline NotLikeThis
[2:43:13] <ZyxWhitewind> I'm pretty excited to play Zafina again

[2:43:34] <NurseLee> @CheeapOne NP man!
[2:43:39] <mexicanlew> good games @ustinodj
[2:43:39] <SweetJP_TV> throw is cool but I can't find a way to confirm into super
[2:43:41] <mexicanlew> ok :)
[2:43:44] <nahuelpv> I remember daigo saying once that he might play honda if he was good
[2:43:49] <autobotcj83> it sounds mkre like "pump you up"
[2:43:53] <sidebysidefgc> thats a cute overhead
[2:43:55] <jackie_chun92> @VesperArcade Do you think she is good as a rush or mixup character with her fireball? Her fireball kinda mehh
[2:43:56] <Mr_Minoan> @VesperArcade Are you surprised Ed was not helped in this the patch. Do you blame yourself?
[2:43:57] <Narrenturmo> honda sounds like saying "Fuck you up" when vtriggering
[2:43:57] <Kibosh_Kaibutsu> try trig 2?
[2:43:59] <sidebysidefgc> It looks like it has 0 range
[2:44:02] <mr__lawyer> @8PoOryGone8 who the fuck is mike ross ?
[2:44:07] <Beats_By_Noel_Brown> whatcha think about the honda costume redesign @VesperArcade
[2:44:19] <AodSnarf> pretty sure it's "fuck you up"
[2:44:19] <sidebysidefgc> wait, was there a balance update?
[2:44:22] <nahuelpv> wait were there balance changes?
[2:44:29] <taken351> no
[2:44:32] <bobdobbz> @vesperarcade just found that Honda can move slightly back and forth during neutral j HP like in 4
[2:44:33] <lemmegetanumber7> there were bug fixes
[2:44:33] <CountMeowingtonn> @VesperArcade How can they help a character that isn't in the game?
[2:44:37] <AdmiralAckbars_Snackbar> its more a space control tol then a damage tool
[2:44:49] <tomfromtheclouds> @vesperarcade I'm so jealous with how fast you find matchups! Last time I had to find a game for the weekly FM, I waited like 10min. I must have a stupid 3 bar connection or something... BibleThump BibleThump
[2:44:58] <icexvader> Do some combos
[2:45:03] <predac0n> It's just a modernized version it's fine tbh
[2:45:05] <sidebysidefgc> his story costume looks cool
[2:45:05] <RobZOObie> @VesperArcade i cant find patchnotes are there none ?
[2:45:06] <NurseLee> Make him join the Tojou Clan from Yakuza that's what!
[2:45:07] <icexvader> In training
[2:45:07] <nahuelpv> honda... with scars WutFace
[2:45:11] <Beats_By_Noel_Brown> Give honda a cardigan @VesperArcade
[2:45:14] <nahuelpv> and a beard
[2:45:17] <SquallAdv> maybe a Yakuza costume as battle costum
[2:45:20] <someguy_zero> He has a suit
[2:45:28] <Darnell16player> @CountMeowingtonn what character?
[2:45:29] <SquallAdv> oh yeah
[2:45:37] <TheMegamansam> Honda, but give him another pair of arms
[2:45:39] <taken351> zeku theme :)
[2:45:40] <Beats_By_Noel_Brown> Give Honda a travis scott outfit I think SeemsGood
[2:45:42] <Game_Art_101> this stage is sick SeemsGood
[2:45:48] <EasXL> one of his colors gives him grey hair and makes him old
[2:45:53] <NurseLee> @Beats_By_Noel_Brown LOL that would be awesome!!!
[2:45:54] <predac0n> Honda needs a big Toyota chain
[2:45:58] <SolitudeGaming> is the bundle available for purchase now?
[2:46:06] <SquallAdv> this stage is also 70K FM right?

[2:46:37] <NurseLee> Zeku and G i would say
[2:46:40] <LAVerde13> ive been waiting lol
[2:46:44] <sidebysidefgc> Vt2 is just easier on Zeku
[2:46:49] <sidebysidefgc> no one actually likes it
[2:46:55] <mexicanlew> does it feel better your side @ustinodj
[2:47:06] <shinyakimura> How's lucia so far? From what I've seen so far, at least Honda looks like he might be competitive.
[2:47:11] <ilikeeverything69> @vesperarcade do you think we'll get a balance patch?
[2:47:14] <AlexIIDX> Wtf playing Lucia....
[2:47:15] <nahuelpv> Hespect

[2:48:14] <SquallAdv> the new stage is 70 or 40k FM?
[2:48:20] <8PoOryGone8> Infex won
[2:48:20] <sidebysidefgc> dont forget to get your free tried at the bison skin
[2:48:21] <EasXL> Bonchan's Sagat was looking clean against Infexious
[2:48:21] <The_Enygma> sometimes when games patch you redownload files, so you're not adding 26 gigs, you're d/ling files you already have
[2:48:23] <Renpool> She has a slide too?
[2:48:27] <RoninWoof> Did Bonchan win with Sagat?
[2:48:28] <Bunky0696> 70k
[2:48:33] <muenshter> Infex came in 3rd...
[2:48:33] <SquallAdv> thx
[2:48:38] <2pieceandabiscuit> does the game even need a balance patch?
[2:48:38] <EasXL> He won with Karin but beat Infexious with Sagat
[2:48:41] <Game_Art_101> @OOZZZY thanks man, finally found it
[2:48:44] <tomfromtheclouds> Infexious won our hearts. 💓 💓 BibleThump
[2:48:45] <Efonzerellie> no wonder my SSD was full

[2:48:53] <SquallAdv> @2pieceandabiscuit Karin
[2:48:56] <sacredsilence67> what do u guys think about zeku and falke
[2:48:59] <shinyakimura> @RoninWoof He did use sagat all the way in some of the matches
[2:49:03] <2pieceandabiscuit> lol
[2:49:06] <mr__lawyer> Infexious got bodied 3-0 by rashid
[2:49:12] <sidebysidefgc> Zeku is sick, falke needs something
[2:49:18] <megatonbeef> @sacredsilence67 Zeku is hype Falke is boring
[2:49:21] <sidebysidefgc> like a personality
[2:49:28] <RoninWoof> I want hom to win the FINAL with Sagat. 😭😭
[2:49:30] <NurseLee> @shinyakimura Bonchan only use Sagat against Infexious Zeku
[2:49:30] <EasXL> Laura and Zangief in top 8 was PogChamp
[2:49:32] <LAVerde13> HARADA with the trolling tho!
[2:49:39] <8PoOryGone8> They should redo Falke, her animations are stiff
[2:49:44] <someguy_zero> Bonchan best Sagat and Karin
[2:49:49] <predac0n> -Falke +Maki
[2:49:50] <aitch2o> Wow, her KO sound is crazy
[2:49:50] <sidebysidefgc> speaking of stiff animations
[2:49:55] <predac0n> we need more Final Fight reps
[2:49:56] <Cobar741> do we have frame data for the new characters already?
[2:50:00] <sidebysidefgc> all the new characters look weird
[2:50:11] <shinyakimura> @predac0n we just got 2 final fight characters tho
[2:50:15] <Biyonzo> so janemba on the 8th huh..anyone hyped?
[2:50:31] <megatonbeef> @biyonzo Hell ya
[2:50:31] <predac0n> @shinyakimura Final Fight it's Capcom's best franchise more never hurts
[2:50:33] <sacredsilence67> @sidebysidefgc I've been grinding with falke and I'm enjoying it, gonna learn zeki
[2:50:39] <akuma236> Janemba looks cool but Gogeta tho
[2:50:45] <aitch2o> C Viper
[2:50:48] <The_Enygma> I'd rather have Bulma. or Roshi.
[2:50:52] <Cobar741> @Biyonzo no sword normals kinda killed a bit of my hype
[2:50:57] <NurseLee> @Biyonzo well he looks awesome and references are on point!
[2:50:58] <sidebysidefgc> Do you get most of your wins by doing vt2 overheads?
[2:51:00] <rashidoo> when is goku coming to dbfz
[2:51:04] <RoninWoof> Arent there a billion Final Fight characters in this already? We need some more SF3 characters.
[2:51:06] <sacredsilence67> @sidebysidefgc unless I cave and buy lucia
[2:51:13] <someguy_zero> GO1 a happy man
[2:51:20] <Darnell16player> I was happy for Momochi. top 16 with Ken mostly. I said ken needs some respect on his name!
[2:51:20] <Biyonzo> i wish janemba had the hit on gogetas forhead before he got decimated
[2:51:22] <8PoOryGone8> Goku with a halo next DLC
[2:51:25] <aitch2o> wtf
[2:51:30] <Greentauros> Lucia mid tier?
[2:51:31] <megatonbeef> @roninwoof There are 4 plus zeku if you count him
[2:51:32] <shinyakimura> Wait a goddamn minute, why does here "double atk button move" not take off HP like Cody's does? lol
[2:51:33] <LaughsWithKnives> yeah how is roshi not in dbz
[2:51:37] <rashidoo> ibuki overhead PogChamp
[2:51:54] <hbktj> Hi vesper
[2:51:57] <aitch2o> "Lucia is what Sakura should've been."

[2:52:10] <freakyyyy8> Nah
[2:52:14] <mr__lawyer> @rashidoo was that safe on block ?
[2:52:15] <senpai817> so what tier is lucia on?
[2:52:17] <ghostfrom3rdstrike> Because there are characters that are more interesting gameplay wise over roshi imo
[2:52:18] <megatonbeef> @aitch2o Fun
[2:52:21] <Clinnamon> the only tier list that matters is thiccness, which honda obviously wins
[2:52:25] <sidebysidefgc> wtf she just came out
[2:52:32] <ps3akuma> You can also do run cancels
[2:52:32] <Darnell16player> fighterz needs less goku but they are obsessed with pushing a moron character
[2:52:34] <aitch2o> @megatonbeef Sakura is so damn fun, OMG
[2:52:37] <ghostfrom3rdstrike> Plus, Roshi can't fly
[2:52:37] <sidebysidefgc> she has top tier thigh highs
[2:52:43] <predac0n> Honda is thicker than a bowl of oatmeal and i'm all about that life
[2:52:45] <blood_wizardd> fuck yeah she does
[2:52:46] <freakyyyy8> THICC HONDA

[2:53:16] <Bunky0696> Oh its the smurf from earlier
[2:53:21] <sidebysidefgc> it should have been Ehaigo Umehonda
[2:53:30] <bobdobbz> @rashidoo have you seen Honda slap his ass after fierce or Roundhouse?
[2:53:31] <swiftruina> Umehonda LUL
[2:53:33] <ghostfrom3rdstrike> I'll take Roshi once all the important ones get added to dbfz first
[2:53:33] <LAVerde13> Mike Ross might come back?

[2:53:55] <aitch2o> Hard punch into hundred hands seems GUUD
[2:53:56] <The_Enygma> they're probably done after S2 anyway
[2:53:59] <blood_wizardd> he does do good damage tbh
[2:54:00] <predac0n> Why Vtrig 1 over Vtrig 2 on Lucia?
[2:54:01] <8PoOryGone8> Mike might just wait for GG at this moment
[2:54:01] <ReimuHakureiShrine> bruh moment
[2:54:08] <akuma236> Is Richard epcar voicing Honda?
[2:54:09] <jackie_chun92> Does Lucia has an overhead guyz?

[3:08:40] <RoninWoof> Though guys, its not about being an ACCURATE accent.... but rather what she is ATTEMPTING to sound like.
[3:08:42] <daMuffinMan007> New Yorkers don't pronounce coffee as Kawww-fee LUL
[3:08:43] <lemmegetanumber7> she sounds like she broke her jaw and it didn't heal right
[3:08:45] <ghostfrom3rdstrike> I'm from Jersey, that is not a jersey accent
[3:08:47] <daMuffinMan007> that's boston
[3:08:48] <Johow33> lol megamind is awesome
[3:08:49] <daMuffinMan007> or jersey
[3:09:01] <ustinodj> @mexicanlew aight I think I am done, the lag is really bad vesperSad
[3:09:01] <ZyxWhitewind> looked at the wiki "It is located on the Atlantic coast of the USA"
[3:09:03] <Kibosh_Kaibutsu> does any of poison or lucia hav secret outfits ?
[3:09:04] <shinyakimura> Metrocity might be based on Motor City. (Detroit)
[3:09:06] <ghostfrom3rdstrike> Muffin man We denied her ghostf16Thinking
[3:09:10] <Beats_By_Noel_Brown> These english voices NotLikeThis
[3:09:15] <daMuffinMan007> we don't want the bitch either LUL
[3:09:20] <HeisenBreh> damn at no one claiming lucia with that accent LUL
[3:09:22] <mexicanlew> @ustinodj gg, do you mind dming me what u think i could improve on?
[3:09:25] <Mantikorew> Mantikorew subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! Did you see the guilty gear teaser? I thought it looked fucking awesome but I'm a weeb so idk.
[3:09:31] <ghostfrom3rdstrike> FUCK IT, ITS AN AUSTRALIAN ACCENT
[3:09:32] <enzo152> vesperCoffee
[3:09:32] <AzureWotan> Only took you 4 years Kappa
[3:09:33] <freakyyyy8> ahhahahaha
[3:09:36] <theMrHeadache> It's generally just a New English accent. People really do sound like that the further you go NE in the US
[3:09:38] <jackie_chun92> @VesperArcade Have you done her trial combos?
[3:09:42] <JinxedEllie> How's it going?
[3:09:53] <torasamu> @vesperarcade is it good vesper?
[3:09:54] <emp_general_tso_chicken> I can't wait for the new GG
[3:09:59] <Johow33> definitely frok California OpieOP
[3:10:00] <emp_general_tso_chicken> looks sooo good
[3:10:03] <くろ様最高> Does Lucia's 6236 K work as a good anti air?
[3:10:03] <megatonbeef> @jackie_chun92 He did
[3:10:05] <ToumaKami> so is Mir working on the lucia combo guide Kappa
[3:10:11] <emp_general_tso_chicken> PS5 is coming out 2020 and GG too
[3:10:12] <DangalfTheKrey> i hate weebs, and anime games in general, but that guilty gear trailer looked SICK af. i bought xrd rev 2 cuz of it
[3:10:13] <ustinodj> @mexicanlew you were doing a lot better than I remember playing you last, I would work on less random v-skills, it seems really good against poison but I started just sitting there and you would random v-skill and I would punish it, poison cant punish it well but a lot of chars can punish it amazingly
[3:10:15] <DasVonUberSchnitzel> Sounds like brooklyn or Jersey
[3:10:15] <K20StoneCold> is she god-like @vesperarcade
[3:10:16] <LAVerde13> That game is anime Tekken
[3:10:17] <bobdobbz> Since Metro City = NY it’s either supposed to be NY or NJ prob
[3:10:21] <emp_general_tso_chicken> @VesperArcade PS5 can play PS4 games natively
[3:10:24] <nahuelpv> i wanted a jojo arc sys
[3:10:25] <freakyyyy8> SFV will be on PS5
[3:10:26] <daMuffinMan007> you know who she sounds like? Birdie.. Sabertooth's chick... "Yess Bossss!"
[3:10:26] <The_Enygma> @VesperArcade PS5/Xbox 2 are back compat
[3:10:32] <HeisenBreh> this gen is bc with next gen so yeah
[3:10:34] <ghostfrom3rdstrike> New GG game has been under wraps for a year and half now so I'm glad they finally announced it
[3:10:45] <Mantikorew> yea the animations were crisp
[3:10:46] <Mantikorew> af
[3:10:52] <JamesEdSmith> EZ win
[3:10:52] <the_mega_guy_> INB4 Auto combos
[3:10:54] <the_mega_guy_> Kappa
[3:10:56] <AzureWotan> @VesperArcade that's Unreal Engine
[3:11:00] <horseapples> yeah, a guilty gear with actual animations is pretty wild
[3:11:02] <emp_general_tso_chicken> I'm really excited for the new GG and KOF15
[3:11:08] <emp_general_tso_chicken> Samurai Shodown is fun as hell
[3:11:15] <daMuffinMan007> was kof15 announced yet?
[3:11:15] <N1njaguy96> Lucia can be my California girl Kreygasm
[3:11:17] <freakyyyy8> GG is the best fighting game anime
[3:11:20] <lionheartrawr> Ohh Wiki says Lucia's accent i based off North Philadelphia
[3:11:20] <LAVerde13> the stage transition is so sick in the new GG
[3:11:22] <swiftruina> They said a while back they were working on it I think.
[3:11:23] <emp_general_tso_chicken> yes kof15 was announced yesterday
[3:11:25] <megatonbeef> @damuffinman007 Yes
[3:11:27] <Johow33> haomaru in sc is sick
[3:11:28] <daMuffinMan007> wow, shit
[3:11:36] <daMuffinMan007> any trailer yet?
[3:11:37] <freakyyyy8> but SFV FTW
[3:11:38] <RoninWoof> This new GG will make me care about GG again.
[3:11:38] <horseapples> more kof ResidentSleeper gimme garou already
[3:11:42] <NurseLee> did you guys read that article where they thought Guilty Gear Xrd Artstyle copied DBZF? And then the article was later pulled because of their ignorancy.
[3:11:52] <emp_general_tso_chicken> there was no trailer they just showed the logo and said "now in development"
[3:11:52] <sidebysidefgc> there are more games than just street fighter
[3:11:58] <The_Enygma> ignorance, not ignorancy
[3:11:58] <bzcharkl> No trailer for KoF15, just the logo
[3:11:58] <daMuffinMan007> ah, k, nice
[3:12:02] <megatonbeef> @damuffinman007 No just an in development announce
[3:12:20] <CountMeowingtonn> mk11 shafted us all by having every match be a bo5
[3:12:22] <daMuffinMan007> they sold enough copies from 2B's ass
[3:12:23] <ghostfrom3rdstrike> @vesperarcade New GG game has been rumored for a good year or 2 now, but they never announced it till now. Same with KOF15.
[3:12:24] <tokenblackdood> soul Calibur got great announcements
[3:12:28] <sidebysidefgc> Maybe, but there was a girl at top 8, I'm proud of her
[3:12:29] <the_mega_guy_> Why no tbag when opponent stunned?
[3:12:36] <ghostfrom3rdstrike> SC6 got season 3 announced
[3:12:53] <The_Enygma> season 2
[3:12:56] <bzcharkl> Season 2 for SC6, season 3 for Tekken
[3:12:58] <tokenblackdood> season 2, new mechanics, haohmaru, and 3 return characters
[3:13:05] <Johow33> ^
[3:13:06] <ghostfrom3rdstrike> KOF 14 was EXTREMELY fun, just noone played it BibleThump
[3:13:07] <lionheartrawr> Setsuka confirmed for Samsho
[3:13:09] <LAVerde13> KPF series is so difficult but very rewarding
[3:13:11] <CountMeowingtonn> I'm not sure if i should commit to sc6, i'm already dog shit at so many fighting games 🤔
[3:13:12] <DangalfTheKrey> sc6 annoucements were sick af, but i'm not sure about that little camera-angle changing mechanic they added to the game... i hope they do away w/ that camera-angle shit.
[3:13:23] <LaughsWithKnives> king of oswald 14
[3:13:26] <ZyxWhitewind> So cassandra is season 1?
[3:13:26] <khalz1998> when does s3 for tekken release...wanna check out the new stuff for akum😅😎
[3:13:33] <RoninWoof> @vesperarcade Start playing SamSho! stop hatin! lol It was so hype at Evo
[3:13:37] <emp_general_tso_chicken> @khalz1998 next month
[3:13:42] <megatonbeef> @ghostfrom3rdstrike Graphics can kill the initial sales people missed the old style
[3:13:42] <emp_general_tso_chicken> tekken S3 is in september
[3:13:44] <GoodBoyDraws> KOF 14 is still by far my favorite to play still. It just fucking works
[3:13:49] <ZyxWhitewind> tekken season 3 in september
[3:13:51] <bobdobbz> Can’t believe SC was even at Evo. That game disappeared after a week
[3:13:57] <lionheartrawr> @DangalfTheKrey didn't they that was for casual?
[3:14:01] <ghostfrom3rdstrike> Tekken 7 season 3 starts September
[3:14:03] <tokenblackdood> @dangalfthekrey my favorite thing is that they reworked Reversal Edge. I was so happy
[3:14:08] <Demented_Hag> it didn't deserve to disappear
[3:14:13] <horseapples> @bobdobbz it's been consistently played at nybc
[3:14:21] <ghostfrom3rdstrike> Rock Howard in KOF14 is godlike
[3:14:25] <reoayanami> so many games will disappear after evo
[3:14:29] <bobdobbz> No but reversal edge was so scrubby
[3:14:34] <LAVerde13> do yall want a SFVI or Capcom all star game?
[3:14:39] <reoayanami> only to reappear at the next Evo. LUL
[3:14:39] <RoninWoof> @vesperarcade is it scheduled to come to PC?
[3:14:44] <bzcharkl> SC6 was and is great, it's just that it came out at a crowded time. That being said I doubt it'd be at Evo 2020, season 2 or not
[3:14:49] <Johow33> sf6
[3:14:57] <LaughsWithKnives> LAVerde13 this is capcom allstars
[3:14:58] <DangalfTheKrey> @lionheartrawr dont think so, it seemed like a new mechanic from the trailer, where a character does something and it like, jerks the camera to some weird angle temporarily. it looks wack
[3:15:00] <gailardia_galan> everyone complaining about reversal edge simply sucks and can't play
[3:15:03] <ghostfrom3rdstrike> But honestly, Capcom needs a new fighting game
[3:15:05] <b1gam3r> @vesperarcade what's your tips on how to get to diamond
[3:15:06] <NurseLee> @LAVerde13 i feel that after SFV, Capcom should take a break form Street Fighter and work on something else
[3:15:08] <gailardia_galan> get good or sthu and go home
[3:15:10] <emp_general_tso_chicken> is SF6 even getting made?
[3:15:12] <ghostfrom3rdstrike> Just announce something
[3:15:15] <LAVerde13> @LaughsWithKnives CHill lol
[3:15:19] <daMuffinMan007> SF6 will be for PS5
[3:15:24] <LaughsWithKnives> atpRtsd4
[3:15:24] <daMuffinMan007> prob launch title
[3:15:24] <nahuelpv> no mvc4 :(
[3:15:29] <daMuffinMan007> or close to launch
[3:15:31] <LAVerde13> @NurseLee I agree
[3:15:33] <megatonbeef> Sf6 on re engine
[3:15:39] <FalcieGaiah> yes no sf6, bring rival schools back or do a cvs game
[3:15:44] <reoayanami> nah, they won't start making SF6 until PS5 is out
[3:15:45] <bobdobbz> @horseapples I just mean I heard nothing about it. I’m sure some are still playing. Wasn’t it the netcode that hamstrung it?
[3:15:50] <LAVerde13> @megatonbeef that would be sick
[3:15:56] <RoninWoof> If SF6 is a launch game it will be the highest selling SF in history LOL
[3:15:59] <sidebysidefgc> oh you can cancel her cr mk!
[3:16:08] <sidebysidefgc> You gotta learn a combo with that
[3:16:08] <daMuffinMan007> i think mvc4 will also be ps5, eventually
[3:16:12] <NurseLee> @LAVerde13 i mean if they do SFVI, then by all means but, i feel like the expectations are gonna be higher and they better not make the same mistakes like in SFV day on launch
[3:16:14] <ghostfrom3rdstrike> Y'all saying ps5 won't be out in the next year or so
[3:16:16] <khalz1998> ono said big announcements coming in NOVEMBER and DECEMBER... theres the winter bundle which has oro..and something else? probably SUPER SF5/SEASON 5
[3:16:16] <lionheartrawr> @DangalfTheKrey was that in the Cass trailer?
[3:16:18] <sidebysidefgc> good sweep punish
[3:16:20] <reoayanami> if SF6 is made by Dimps again, they will definitely use Unreal Engine
[3:16:32] <daMuffinMan007> ps5 should be out next holiday
[3:16:37] <thelexnard> it's too bad Lucia has ass CC conversions
[3:16:37] <daMuffinMan007> end of 2020
[3:16:38] <DangalfTheKrey> @lionheartrawr no, it was in the 2nd season announcement trailer. it was after cassie reveal
[3:16:50] <ghostfrom3rdstrike> Xbox already has their next console dropping next holiday so we're not far
[3:16:51] <LAVerde13> @NurseLee I feel that SFV should be done as soon as the PS5 gets announced
[3:17:00] <ghostfrom3rdstrike> It's about time for a new Capcom Fighter
[3:17:01] <ahrenk> vesper stop bullying poor silver players trying to have fun
[3:17:08] <khalz1998> SF6 on the REengine? PogChamp
[3:17:13] <sa1k0> respect the law
[3:17:18] <reoayanami> SF4 wasn't done when PS4 got announced
[3:17:20] <DangalfTheKrey> judge lucia
[3:17:27] <ghostfrom3rdstrike> Capcom already announced multiple games in RE Engine
[3:17:30] <estarix> smurfin murfin
[3:17:30] <NurseLee> @LAVerde13 well it seems that 2020 might be the last cycle for SFV and it makes sense due to ps5 rumors.
[3:17:34] <DangalfTheKrey> I AM THE LO-WAH
[3:17:36] <Teh_Wrecker> hes saving them from that honda anyway
[3:17:37] <beqwibber> SF6 probably won't come out until 2 years after the PS5 is released. Right now it's way too early for another SF game
[3:17:43] <Zulfikeay> What the hell is KupaKawfee !? reoTroll
[3:17:45] <happyurepiyoroshikune> just tuned in vesper, whats your opinion on lucia? shes looking mighty fine i might pick her up
[3:17:48] <swiftruina> SFV will probably be ported to PS5
[3:17:50] <Beats_By_Noel_Brown> SF4 was more warmly received thru its life
[3:17:54] <OOZZZY> cr. mk into hard dp
[3:17:55] <enzo152> i think the bundle released as soon as the server was open @VesperArcade
[3:18:00] <LAVerde13> SF6 makes sense to be a PS5 launch title
[3:18:04] <icexvader> I feel like the end of her super is so anti climatic
[3:18:06] <ustinodj> like I predicted, honda is fuckin stupid
[3:18:20] <ghostfrom3rdstrike> Then make another Vs Game
[3:18:23] <bobdobbz> Honda’s sick
[3:18:28] <rashidoo> see my honder ustin Kappa
[3:18:28] <MRvicent> im palying on PC with the characters... u have to find the bundle manually through the store.
[3:18:34] <LAVerde13> i think it would be smart for Capcom to do that, just look at KI on Xbox One
[3:18:39] <ghostfrom3rdstrike> We can keep 5, just make another game to go along with it
[3:18:39] <sa1k0> male ken vs female ken
[3:18:41] <Beats_By_Noel_Brown> And it was that day Ono decided to add Seth after watching @VesperArcade stream
[3:18:47] <ustinodj> @VesperArcade I try to use poison's whip to space honda, and then he just headbutts the hurtbox on my whipp
[3:18:50] <reoayanami> no it doesn't. launch titles require tons of money from console makers to happen. Sony would rather spend that money on more popular games
[3:18:53] <estarix> lol
[3:18:53] <DangalfTheKrey> no1 can handle ratshit
[3:18:53] <khalz1998> Hondas Bathwater
[3:18:57] <beqwibber> @LAVerde13 No it doesn't, maybe it it had been released in 2014, but not this early
[3:19:00] <liuginator> @liuginator is new here. Say hello! SeemsGood
[3:19:07] <DangalfTheKrey> i swear ratshit's the most broken character in this game. name ONE weakness he has, ill wait.
[3:19:11] <LC_Spacely> I can't find the damn bundle TableHere FlipThis
[3:19:12] <ustinodj> @rashidoo do you wanna do lobbies?
[3:19:16] <Renpool> Did u check out poison yet?
[3:19:17] <Kristoffers> I don't wanna imagine honda smashing anyone
[3:19:22] <Blacque> So... is... the new stuff fm only?
[3:19:27] <swiftruina> Rashid just needs to knock him down once.
[3:19:29] <RoninWoof> SHE SOUNDS LIKE CARDI B....thats NEW YORK! HA!
[3:19:30] <Beats_By_Noel_Brown> Hes more of a ground and pound @Kristoffers
[3:19:31] <rashidoo> oh that reminds me, my ethernet cable broke
[3:19:32] <Renpool> Ducky gets no respect
[3:19:35] <megatonbeef> @lc_spacely Not on psn yet
[3:19:40] <rashidoo> i have to go get a new one
[3:19:42] <MRvicent> @LC_Spacely g oto store on the street fighter V scrol ldown on the dlc and click browse then look for it there
[3:19:47] <Megasizer> ken vs ken Pog
[3:19:47] <DangalfTheKrey> @Blacque no, u can get the character bundle
[3:19:50] <estarix> oh no we got chris tartarian over here
[3:19:52] <ustinodj> @rashidoo doesnt matter, you cant duck
[3:19:57] <Kristoffers> NotLikeThis
[3:19:59] <Blacque> Oh didn't see it on the steam let me double checks.
[3:19:59] <rashidoo> but iz gunna laaag
[3:20:02] <Darnell16player> ken gets no respect due to too many people complaining and whining
[3:20:04] <LC_Spacely> @megatonbeef that's tough
[3:20:11] <dokkorashot> @dokkorashot is new here. Say hello! VoHiYo
[3:20:11] <estarix> he had to the tatsu lol, bronze special
[3:20:13] <Hulkbusterv3> LUL
[3:20:13] <OOZZZY> on steam it is the Summer 2019 Character Bundle
[3:20:25] <nahuelpv> the ultimate ken strat
[3:20:26] <Renpool> His fire uppercut is so much Damage
[3:20:29] <icexvader> We don’t need more broken characters. We have enough. We need buffs and NERFS DAMMIT
[3:20:33] <swiftruina> Typical Ken play LUL
[3:20:33] <rashidoo> winning off of lag is worse than losing for me ustin vesperCawfee
[3:20:38] <aitch2o> Walk speed look cammy est
[3:20:41] <ghostfrom3rdstrike> Ken players are the equivalent to Scorpion players in mk11
[3:20:41] <the_mega_guy_> Whenever somebody says "I teched that" I have a hard time believing them
[3:20:49] <sidebysidefgc> is the final hit of vskil not cancellable?
[3:20:50] <Tw4904> I cant stand when people play the most offensive characters in the most passive way
[3:21:01] <Renpool> Honda’s throw seems pretty good too
[3:21:02] <budafuka> @estarix You mean the diamond special
[3:21:02] <megatonbeef> @the_mega_guy_ I partied it I swear
[3:21:06] <Beats_By_Noel_Brown> waitin on that uppercut
[3:21:09] <DangalfTheKrey> @Tw4904 justin wong would like to say hi
[3:21:10] <megatonbeef> Parry
[3:21:10] <Beats_By_Noel_Brown> THERE IT WAS
[3:21:13] <reoayanami> maybe they think that they can still mash crouch tech. LUL
[3:21:15] <Tw4904> like why pick ken if your gonna walk yourself into the corner
[3:21:16] <the_mega_guy_> @megatonbeef LUL
[3:21:19] <LAVerde13> @reoayanami capcom would make hella money if they invested in sf6 as launch title because it would be the only fighter on ps5 at that time. Capcom can capitalize on that
[3:21:22] <Rennlar> It looks like ken and Sakura fuision
[3:21:24] <b1gam3r> that Ken flew
[3:21:27] <ghostfrom3rdstrike> He called the uppercut LUL LUL
[3:21:29] <rashidoo> justece awlways-
[3:21:29] <Beats_By_Noel_Brown> Shinryuken special
[3:21:32] <ninjavanish> poisons AAs are poop
[3:21:34] <dankmemeslov> ken players party hard
[3:21:35] <Renpool> Good punish
[3:21:39] <MikeTales> At some point they gotta figure out the jumping isnt working right?
[3:21:40] <DangalfTheKrey> @Tw4904 that sweaty fatfuck made a career of playing lame w/ any and all characters, including rushdown characters like rufus in sf4 LUL
[3:21:41] <estarix> is her normal anti air any good?
[3:21:48] <FalcieGaiah> @LAVerde13 It wouldn't be tho, both ps5 and the new xbox will be backwards compatible
[3:21:51] <ghostfrom3rdstrike> Scorpion players randomly teleport and Ken players randomly dp and H tatsu
[3:21:53] <reoayanami> @laverde13 there is no player base at launch. Capcom would make no money. it's common sense.
[3:22:04] <the_mega_guy_> the p vesperMouth
[3:22:06] <Renpool> She feels more like guy to me than zeku
[3:22:06] <icexvader> Ooo
[3:22:06] <khalz1998> BullyArcade LUL
[3:22:09] <rashidoo> she's got an ex dp so thats something
[3:22:14] <AdmiralAckbars_Snackbar> Sonic not feeling Lucia @VesperArcade
[3:22:19] <Chicken_Curry_Rice> honda pretty vesper
[3:22:23] <beqwibber> @LAVerde13 It's crazy to be talking about another SF game so soon, what a selfish thing to ask for so soon
[3:22:24] <EXunspect> show me dome tech
[3:22:33] <RoninWoof> @reoayanami bullshit.. launch games are gauranteed sells
[3:22:34] <the_mega_guy_> wasn't expecting a rematch
[3:22:36] <Renpool> Ken crying
[3:22:40] <ghostfrom3rdstrike> So when are we gonna get some Alpha characters
[3:22:50] <ghostfrom3rdstrike> Still waiting for Maki
[3:22:52] <Beats_By_Noel_Brown> what sort of nerfs would you give Karin and Rashid @VesperArcade
[3:22:54] <aitch2o> What's her v skill?
[3:22:56] <icexvader> Once a ken gets caught for their dirty tricks. They RUN
[3:23:01] <shinyakimura> technically Mika is an Alpha character
[3:23:07] <bgnocturne> Is this fat Elon musk ?
[3:23:10] <sa1k0> Mika was already an Alpha character LUL
[3:23:10] <ZyxWhitewind> saving them for sf6
[3:23:11] <ustinodj> are you gonna fuckin play me ya 🦆
[3:23:11] <LAVerde13> @beqwibber its a discussion, your being selfish in thinking that im selfish
[3:23:11] <megatonbeef> @shinyakimura And Karin
[3:23:20] <Renpool> Kage is Dan
[3:23:25] <megatonbeef> And Nash
[3:23:26] <reoayanami> @roninwoof more then a game launching on a console with 100 million units sold? get out of here.

[3:23:49] <budafuka> The only nerfs Karin needs are grapplers getting buffed
[3:23:53] <beqwibber> @LAVerde13 The discussion shouldn't be happening period. You don't deserve anything
[3:23:54] <DangalfTheKrey> rashid needs an overhaul. he is so fuckin overloaded. name 1 thing he DOESN"T have in this game. name 1 weakness. he has none, literally.
[3:23:55] <dmjaraxxus> is her v skill the lightning legs or the run?
[3:24:00] <RobZOObie> @VesperArcade as for ratshit I mean fuck .... that made my day Thank you !
[3:24:04] <ghostfrom3rdstrike> Just give me Maki and Dudley and I'm good
[3:24:05] <rashidoo> fine ill play u in a sec
[3:24:10] <RoninWoof> You act like 100 million people buy SF....
[3:24:11] <budafuka> Delete Rashid
[3:24:13] <rashidoo> but i warned ye
[3:24:16] <LAVerde13> @beqwibber I deserve the world and everything in it
[3:24:24] <Vasionqt> have you figured anything out after roundhouse crush counter?
[3:24:29] <jensy0101> I was expecting Sodom
[3:24:30] <Renpool> Rashid allowed fang to live
[3:24:37] <Vasionqt> specifically roundhouse crush counter at max range
[3:24:38] <shredmaster96> ironmeS
[3:24:47] <ghostfrom3rdstrike> 100 mil people would buy street fighter if it's content rich and it looked good
[3:24:49] <torasamu> @VesperArcade is she good, vesper?
[3:24:51] <doh__> so no balance changes
[3:24:58] <lornosaj> Is Lucia good ?
[3:25:05] <DangalfTheKrey> @budafuka i'm usually a hardcore 'git gud scrub' when it comes to balance, but ratshit is so unhealthy for the game. even sf4 vanilla sagat and akuma had some sort of weakness.
[3:25:10] <ghostfrom3rdstrike> Many people buy MK because it looks good and it's content rich.
[3:25:11] <megatonbeef> @ghostfrom3rdstrike get those ultra sf2 on switch sales
[3:25:16] <Beats_By_Noel_Brown> her damage output seems on the low side
[3:25:19] <aitch2o> What's her slide on hit and block?
[3:25:22] <johnieshabravo> she can go into shoulder tackle from hk CC
[3:25:22] <RoninWoof> But at launch there LIMITED options on games to buy.... and everyone buying a new console will buy games.
[3:25:38] <fuzzyrpg> Mk has best visuals by far, but the stiff gamepaly makes me a sad panda
[3:25:43] <ZyxWhitewind> i wanna play spawn but i dont want to play mk...
[3:25:47] <shinzo1987> just messing about with her, you can cancel both her vskill and target combo into vtrigger which gives a bit more of a juggle
[3:25:50] <shinyakimura> I just realized that her projectile is K's (from KOF) move, lol
[3:25:56] <aitch2o> Wooow +3 on hit.
[3:25:56] <ghostfrom3rdstrike> Nah DBFZ has the best visuals in terms of fighting games
[3:25:59] <gonzilla0> i think st. MP - cr. MK to run kicks does more damage than the tatsu
[3:26:01] <Beats_By_Noel_Brown> I wonder if these characters are shades of what to expect next season @VesperArcade
[3:26:07] <Kyros85> vesper do you know what switch guard direction is?
[3:26:08] <the_mega_guy_> @ZyxWhitewind play soul calibur 2 Kappa
[3:26:10] <fuzzyrpg> COUNTER SMURFFED!
[3:26:11] <jensy0101> I was expecting Sodom but I want Garuda BibleThump
[3:26:13] <torasamu> ''not bad 4Head ''
[3:26:23] <bgnocturne> Fat Elon musk getting rekt
[3:26:30] <rashidoo> gime 1 more min ustin
[3:26:30] <Beats_By_Noel_Brown> Zeku had like v reversal changes that came for everyone next season
[3:26:32] <ghostfrom3rdstrike> MK is a close second, outside of other arcsys games, nothing can compete with DBFZ visuals
[3:26:33] <Akadi_LoR> All that SPD
[3:26:33] <ZyxWhitewind> I played heihachi then Kappa
[3:26:40] <torasamu> american flag? @VesperArcade WutFace
[3:26:48] <aitch2o> Something new in training mode?
[3:26:49] <reoayanami> considering how many problems and stock issues consoles run into at launch, it would still take awhile to reach 2 million which iwas SFV's target. by then there would be plenty of titles already.
[3:27:02] <Beats_By_Noel_Brown> Gief lookin like a gimp in that mask
[3:27:15] <Kibosh_Kaibutsu> am still waiting for granblue fantasy vs
[3:27:17] <leonthagod> sfv training mode is so much better than mk11
[3:27:32] <gailardia_galan> @roninwoof you are expecting many people to buy the PS5 at launch with the price tag they are charging for it at launch. it would be better if they released 6 about a year or two after launch of Ps5
[3:27:35] <EXunspect> @vesperarcade does lucia hase a crosscut DP?
[3:27:37] <freakyyyy8> hahahaha low low
[3:27:43] <OOZZZY> yes she has cross cut dp
[3:27:43] <Gyari> lucia is fun af
[3:27:48] <DangalfTheKrey> @Kibosh_Kaibutsu that game looks phenomenal, visually, but it seems like it has some frame lag or something
[3:27:53] <DangalfTheKrey> doesn't look smoothe
[3:28:01] <MetalxOath> Is there ever a reason to use EX tackle? it air resets and it seems you get more damage just doing the normal one into jab
[3:28:22] <sa1k0> did you have a cup of cawfee to stay up all night during the stream, @vesperarcade ? PixelBob Kappa
[3:28:23] <machriphi> Yo, what up VesperArcade
[3:28:34] <Kibosh_Kaibutsu> @DangalfTheKrey yea i played the beta, like i had 3 really good games, the rest was ok

[3:29:17] <ghostfrom3rdstrike> The games that are most likely gonna be PS5 launch titles is Last Of Us 2, Maybe Spider Man 2, and probably a new ip
[3:29:17] <lordcawfee> My name became a meme overnight
[3:29:18] <machriphi> @putridcheese No, she's from Final Fight 3 but also has flaming kicks.

[3:34:50] <ZyxWhitewind> !okie
[3:34:50] <Nightbot> Okizamboney (ケツを食ベる) is a term used in fighting games to generally describe your wake up game. To be more specific, this is when players (professionals mostly) will set alarms to randomly wake up at odd hours of the night to play a match online before going back to sleep. The idea is to make yourself better while mentally exhausted, since tournaments can last as long as 48 hours without time for rest. -tsuchinokoDemon
[3:34:58] <NurseLee> @VesperArcade I cant because I don't have enough Fight money lol
[3:35:02] <ghostfrom3rdstrike> This man jumps good reoBoon

[3:36:19] <machriphi> I bought all the characters on my main account with FM, but I earned a bunch before the drought.
[3:36:23] <ClamantJTV> Let rip!
[3:36:23] <rashidoo> war

[3:39:15] <rbrut> PermaSmug
[3:39:20] <rashidoo> thats my second loss on this acct
[3:39:22] <ZyxWhitewind> crossups beats footsies
[3:39:23] <bobdobbz> Honda’s VT2 is an ochio that puts them in the corner from full screen @vesperarcade
[3:39:29] <ClamantJTV> @machriphi Well fuck me, ken is a plagiarizer

[3:40:03] <Kibosh_Kaibutsu> honda online , ez 100 win streak
[3:40:06] <Vanillarune> is it a good idea to go to local fgc even if im new and going to get destroyed? maybe waste their time too
[3:40:08] <enzo152> i made a poison booty emote @that_lnsomniac_zack
[3:40:17] <chongisopa> Does she have a wake up inv do?
[3:40:18] <that_lnsomniac_zack> @enzo152 strangeWow
[3:40:26] <donutz321> lemme see
[3:40:31] <enzo152> strangeBeary
[3:40:34] <chongisopa> Dp *
[3:40:41] <that_lnsomniac_zack> strangeBeary @enzo152
[3:40:46] <ZyxWhitewind> That's usually what I see at lower rank. you try to poke them then they just jump over your normals. gotta recognize when they are not going to play footsies with you.
[3:41:04] <ghostfrom3rdstrike> He's right
[3:41:16] <Vanillarune> often see fchamp there
[3:41:24] <ghostfrom3rdstrike> Went to my local and that helped me level up in dbfz like crazy
[3:41:33] <ghostfrom3rdstrike> I finally understand where i fall short
[3:41:35] <XenoSF> Where is the bundle on the ps4 version?
[3:41:35] <gailardia_galan> @vanillarune where are you? what state?
[3:41:43] <machriphi> @Vanillarune Poison seems pretty good. Good normals, anti airs, damage, corner carry, oki. The only thing that doesn't seem very strong is her VTs aren't robbery. That said I didn't get much time to explore the VTs too much so maybe they've got cool stuff too.
[3:41:57] <ustinodj> make that 3 losses
[3:41:58] <rashidoo> how did u beat my perfect cast
[3:42:00] <NurseLee> @XenoSF I don't think it's out yet they said the 5th i don't know when exactly.
[3:42:29] <ustinodj> @rashidoo this char giving me falke ptsd btw
[3:42:41] <XenoSF> That’s what I thought.
[3:42:45] <rashidoo> shes a lil better hurtbox wise
[3:42:52] <rashidoo> but ye she got the syndrome
[3:42:56] <Wutevadude> does all characters sweat in this level, just e honda or am i watching too deep into it?
[3:43:01] <icey7777> she looks pretty execution heavy
[3:43:02] <avantistarre> @VesperArcade Based on what you've played so far, do you think Lucia is fun? I'm thinking about jumping in with her for a bit
[3:43:10] <XenoSF> No bundle on ps4 yet.
[3:43:10] <shinzo1987> thing about low ranks is players find 1 thing that works and over use it and become extremely one dimensional, if you wan't to climb learn all aspects and not lean on a single tactic like a crutch
[3:43:34] <machriphi> Yeah, people play to win instead of playing to get better
[3:43:52] <Darnell16player> ^one reason why i stopped with sport games
[3:43:52] <ghostfrom3rdstrike> @vesperarcade I finally went to my local and that helped me level up in dbfz. Got ton of praise but alot of people told me i take too long to adapt, and I worked on it. Locals help a ton
[3:44:03] <that_lnsomniac_zack> practicing Poisons whip cancel is doodInjury
[3:44:06] <donutz321> how do you grind fight money?
[3:44:08] <gailardia_galan> the purpose of getting is to win though. @darnell16player
[3:44:13] <Vanillarune> @gailardia_galan im from philippines
[3:44:19] <ustinodj> vesperKilley
[3:44:20] <Wafflez1909> Yo, the background flashing is layered over the ui
[3:44:20] <inayatred> I'm lazy BibleThump
[3:44:22] <gailardia_galan> Ah, the philippines
[3:44:24] <rashidoo> :)
[3:44:25] <machriphi> @donutz321 On a fresh account doing character stories take like 1 minute each and give you 5k FM
[3:44:25] <sa1k0> soo which is easier to play: Poison or Lucia?
[3:44:28] <SaltyNegro> haha poison whip cancels are nothing for viper mains hahaha
[3:44:28] <fisticuffsclub> she feels bad
[3:44:30] <InfectedJazz> Just do Trials,Survival easy,Character stories.
[3:44:32] <JabMasher> @donutz321 create a smurf then do character story modes, will take you around 30 mins for a single char
[3:44:37] <ustinodj> I found that headbutt AA hitbox mir was talking about
[3:44:42] <Biyonzo> @that_lnsomniac_zack what is the motion for it
[3:44:51] <blackgeeky> Make a fight money guide Kappa
[3:44:56] <donutz321> @machriphi @JabMasher Thanx Tee hee im bout to try all dee new characterz
[3:45:00] <donutz321> im broke as shit
[3:45:02] <Darnell16player> @gailardia_galan I know that. I play with ken in this game and momochi got him to top 16. Yet i feel the character still doesn't get respect
[3:45:07] <ghostfrom3rdstrike> oof
[3:45:10] <ghostfrom3rdstrike> BibleThump
[3:45:12] <aitch2o> I hate dat.
[3:45:20] <enzo152> @that_lnsomniac_zack whats your discord?
[3:45:21] <NurseLee> @sa1k0 well depends what kinda a character you like. One's more of a zoner, other is a Rushdown
[3:45:27] <Vasionqt> idk if shes good but lord she's fun
[3:45:30] <gailardia_galan> Ken will never get respect until someone Absolutely destroys with him. @darnell16player
[3:45:32] <InfectedJazz> I like her.
[3:45:32] <donutz321> buff her buttonz a little bit more
[3:45:33] <enzo152> She looks fun
[3:45:34] <shinzo1987> I think she is good but she is extremely reliant on vtrigger
[3:45:34] <techeroz> How you liking her
[3:45:34] <ghostfrom3rdstrike> She looks fun
[3:45:36] <that_lnsomniac_zack> @biyonzo qcb p then k to cancel
[3:45:37] <eeega> Not bad Kappa
[3:45:38] <Llesor> she has lots of options
[3:45:38] <Vanillarune> fchamp go to my local scene to commentate matches but i heard he isnt a good person?
[3:45:41] <enzo152> she looks decent - good
[3:45:42] <machriphi> I haven't tried her yet, was playing Poison tonight. Haven't watched much of your stream either.
[3:45:42] <ZyxWhitewind> trash Kappa play honda Kappa
[3:45:43] <Wutevadude> she’s probably codys older sister
[3:45:44] <youngj00> I think her fireball game is going to give grapplers nightmares!
[3:45:46] <gailardia_galan> I think she is fun. I haven't played SFV in years but she makes me want to play SFV again
[3:45:47] <StevenAitsover> lol vesper online
[3:45:51] <dmjaraxxus> plz vt2
[3:45:53] <Kristoffers> sure
[3:45:59] <cjGRAYSON> she reminds ppl of ken alot
[3:46:02] <aitch2o> She look like a glass cannon like I said. I like glass cannons.
[3:46:10] <andersandman1> i think she ia a dificult chata ter because she have só many stuff
[3:46:11] <Darnell16player> @gailardia_galan Which is stupid because too many people bitched during s1 and he has nerfed to the ground for no reason since
[3:46:12] <sa1k0> can I use fm from smurf account in the other account? lul
[3:46:13] <shinzo1987> she is what juri should have been
[3:46:20] <andersandman1> character
[3:46:24] <ProT0Hype> n
[3:46:26] <JabMasher> @Vanillarune it's mostly 90% act, hes a good person
[3:46:31] <giefreplays> FeelsBadMan
[3:46:33] <rashidoo> forgib me
[3:46:35] <aitch2o> Zangief cheating. He starts with a Foot over the line. SMG
[3:46:37] <aitch2o> SMH
[3:46:37] <rashidoo> for i have sinnd
[3:46:39] <Kibosh_Kaibutsu> her trig 2 seems interesting
[3:46:43] <ProT0Hype> she needs to be nerfed lol
[3:46:55] <ustinodj> no more games
[3:47:03] <rashidoo> so be it
[3:47:07] <rashidoo> vesperPalm
[3:47:08] <NaughtyJuri> I don't know why people don't like this stage it's a classic.
[3:47:08] <machriphi> @Vanillarune I don't know him personally, but I've heard that he kind like to play the villain in FGC and a lot of it is a persona he puts on.
[3:47:13] <Wafflez1909> there it was again
[3:47:17] <gailardia_galan> @darnell16player People hate on shotos. All shotos except Akuma. which is fucked and weird. Ken style has one of the most diverse playstyles to me in this game though.
[3:47:29] <StevenAitsover> anyone patch changes?
[3:47:31] <Wafflez1909> look at the CPT rank ui when the round finishes
[3:47:40] <coffintactics> Man dude I’m really liking these characters this is the first time I’ve wanted to play everyone
[3:47:49] <CrimzenDagger> how's lucia vesper?
[3:47:51] <Vanillarune> thanks for telling me
[3:48:00] <machriphi> @StevenAitsover No patch changes, but they said there's another update coming at Capcom Cup so they're probably waiting until the Pro Tour ends before fucking with the balance.
[3:48:01] <Llesor> yeah
[3:48:05] <Llesor> they all seem fun
[3:48:07] <Wafflez1909> the ui gets covered by the flashing background
[3:48:14] <sa1k0> but if I grind FM, will all that begone after trial period, @vesperarcade ?
[3:48:19] <enzo152> is the shp floating captain? vesperCaptain @VesperArcade
[3:48:22] <sonic_sol> 97 raiders from sonic_sol have joined! 
[3:48:24] <MrKarlSync> @VesperArcade So is Oro & C.Viper coming during the winter?
[3:48:25] <ToumaKami> I enjoy watching Vesper fighting Ehonda
[3:48:26] <Darnell16player> @gailardia_galan Diverse sure and yet you say he will never get respect so i find it hard to believe you after that. if momochi can make it to top 16 using him a lot more than that should say something
[3:48:29] <rashidoo> raid wow3e
[3:48:32] <Mantikorew> From what I have found she seems to have great options but lackluster reward. IDK.
[3:48:38] <aitch2o> Vesper, what's her v skill?
[3:48:38] <StevenAitsover> lucia belong in kof15
[3:48:51] <NaughtyJuri> Raid PMSTwin
[3:48:54] <cfmgjay> HEY I JUST MET YOU! & THIS IS CRAZY BUT HERES MY NUMBER (712) 432-8812 SO CALL ME MAYBE
[3:48:55] <coffintactics> Yeah I was hoping for some balance changes too, but also I main Karin so....
[3:48:56] <Kibosh_Kaibutsu> damn, even after evo
[3:49:10] <Kristoffers> who took out problem x and punk?
[3:49:17] <ZyxWhitewind> trials for characters you don't own doesnt give any credit
[3:49:19] <NaughtyJuri> Bonchan has alot of points damn
[3:49:23] <gailardia_galan> @darnell16player exactly. I personally love Ken but people will hate as always
[3:49:26] <aitch2o> How strong does Bonchan look?
[3:49:30] <donutz321> top 5 in cpt are hoarding da pointz
[3:49:31] <ustinodj> @rashidoo How - is headbutt
[3:49:31] <Vzu_> WTF capcom actually did a good job characters a friggin fun DansGame

[3:49:43] <Kibosh_Kaibutsu> i think X took out punk then i forgot who got X
[3:49:45] <cfmgjay> EVERYBODY CHECKOUT THE BROWNBEARTV CHANEL
[3:49:48] <rashidoo> light is -4, the rest are more

[3:49:55] <sonic_sol> I'm not mike ross @VesperArcade
[3:50:04] <RobZOObie> well vt1 again lol
[3:50:19] <Mantikorew> Wait did we get raided by that one samsho player?
[3:50:24] <AlexIIDX> Thank god Bonchan won...Rashid was a mistake
[3:50:38] <Panik64> Bonchan really deserved it
[3:50:40] <Chicken_Curry_Rice> rather karin win than rashit
[3:50:48] <sonic_sol> her oki feels so shiiiiiiiiiit
[3:50:52] <ZyxWhitewind> vesperScratch vesperScratch vesperScratch
[3:50:53] <Darnell16player> okay why do people hate rashid?
[3:51:08] <machriphi> @Darnell16player Because he's almost as stupid as Ken Kappa
[3:51:08] <MrKarlSync> Has the top 8 not been uploaded to twitch yet?
[3:51:12] <ZyxWhitewind> annoying to fight against
[3:51:23] <JamesEdSmith> I like that Honda has some trainer tape on. If you watch real Sumo, a lot of guys are wearing that since Sumo is pretty dangerous and guys get nagging injuries pretty often
[3:51:29] <aitch2o> Oh, switching to v trigger II was only for training?
[3:51:29] <Joiztik> Wow smurfin
[3:51:30] <NurseLee> @Darnell16player He's one of the best characters of the game.
[3:51:32] <tatomagix> Poison seems way more impressive
[3:51:33] <rashidoo> i need to ch3ck the frame data too
[3:51:37] <gailardia_galan> people hate Rashid because he is literally how every in this game is supposed to be or at least close to it @darnell16player
[3:51:37] <Darnell16player> @machriphi Ken isn't stupid now. i feel you hate ken for no reason
[3:51:43] <MutedMimic> LUL
[3:51:44] <AzureWotan> LOL
[3:51:46] <AlexIIDX> Hate watching him instantly corner u and start his boring pressure
[3:51:48] <GeneiYun> @Darnell16player way too linear and boring to watch
[3:51:48] <AzureWotan> NOT EVEN A PUNISH

[3:53:13] <cpcp3> cute honda <3 BegWan
[3:53:25] <Renpool> Rashid is crazy and rushdown not everyone is a fan of his unpredictable antics
[3:53:26] <jlocke714> it's like that east coast accent...

[3:56:29] <MetalxOath> if crHP whiffs use crMK @VesperArcade
[3:56:32] <Mantikorew> should be interuptable by 3f buttons
[3:56:32] <FalcieGaiah> but aren't those all negative on block anyways @VesperArcade ?
[3:56:38] <kingofrogs> but my connection isnt that fast
[3:56:45] <Raynys> jeeez, Lucia's normals....they're nice

[3:57:06] <DevSF4> cant wait for the Mods to get to work on her
[3:57:07] <shaboogen> you'll block the 3f
[3:57:11] <ZyxWhitewind> doodBigBrain
[3:57:17] <YouKnow232> ex run stop is 2 frames safer
[3:57:23] <Blacque> Lucia's idle animation gives me the anxiety,
[3:57:37] <kingofrogs> @015kirb you are lucky :)
[3:57:44] <GutterMagic> oh wow

[3:58:08] <Kawaiidin> fchamp is saying she's top 3 LUL
[3:58:09] <cjGRAYSON> she is KEN

[3:58:21] <ZyxWhitewind> Wait is she... Guy? PogChamp
[3:58:21] <Llesor> she seemed unga bunga by her trailer

[3:58:28] <Llesor> NOOOOD
[3:58:28] <sa1k0> Sakura was already on the bench
[3:58:29] <aitch2o> Unga bunga? Nuts?
[3:58:30] <kingofrogs> wtf??? my eyes are deceiving , im saying ken
[3:58:34] <AdmiralAckbars_Snackbar> according to sonicsol she ahs no oki though @VesperArcade
[3:58:34] <kingofrogs> not ken plzzzzzzzzzzzzz
[3:58:37] <emp_general_tso_chicken> Vesper is 4x weak to raw supers LUL
[3:58:39] <AzureWotan> add it to the count!
[3:58:49] <cl4ptpy> how much coast the new fighters ?
[3:58:53] <IZicken> female ken with those run cancels
[3:58:54] <kingofrogs> dont ken her
[3:58:57] <ustinodj> vesperKilley
[3:59:02] <rashidoo> that move is such cancer lmao
[3:59:07] <Forticon> @cl4ptpy $5.99 each / 100,000FM each or $14.99 for the pack of 3
[3:59:09] <DevSF4> Is Chris T gona pick her up?
[3:59:15] <ustinodj> I have a theory
[3:59:16] <cl4ptpy> lol
[3:59:16] <rashidoo> these medium pokes feel really good
[3:59:18] <shaboogen> if she doesn't have oki, end combos with the v.skill
[3:59:21] <Darnell16player> capcom hates ken and anything like him so expect her to be smacked with the nerfs
[3:59:23] <ustinodj> aw fuk I crashed one sec
[3:59:28] <YouKnow232> shoulder is safe on block when spaced well too
[3:59:32] <StevenAitsover> i think strong characters like this is healthy for the gtame
[3:59:32] <ustinodj> I think I know honda's weakness tho
[3:59:33] <rashidoo> alt tabbin NotLikeThis
[3:59:36] <kingofrogs> ok i see now, she is a mix of karin and ken
[3:59:41] <ustinodj> maybe Kappa
[3:59:42] <fisticuffsclub> all you have to do against her is block. probably not gonna happen in silver or gold Kappa
[3:59:48] <Llesor> OH NOOO
[3:59:53] <rashidoo> gorillas have no weakness they are the apex alpha
[3:59:53] <kingofrogs> she can cancel into shoulder or just a run
[4:00:10] <015kirb> @kingofrogs not really cause the game got fucked for me. can't see the new characters in select screen or anywhere else. if I try to watch replays for these new characters. they get replaced by ryu and Ken.
[4:00:17] <aitch2o> OH SHIT, her super looks like a frame trap.
[4:00:18] <cl4ptpy> end of year come Ultra street fighter 5
[4:00:29] <Llesor> @kingofrogs she has the run cancel, the shoulder, a kick and v-skill
[4:00:32] <Llesor> all in the cmd dash
[4:00:37] <sa1k0> Capcom hates Ken? Then they must despise Ryu wholeheartedly LUL
[4:00:44] <kingofrogs> @015kirb restart the game
[4:00:45] <aitch2o> The first Frame Trap super?
[4:00:47] <ustinodj> @rashidoo did you leave?
[4:00:52] <rashidoo> nah im still here

[4:01:04] <Kawaiidin> @VesperArcade Makoto'd
[4:01:05] <kingofrogs> ok, so lucia is basically the secret daughter of ken and karin
[4:01:07] <captainfirefeet> that was clean
[4:01:10] <Darnell16player> @sa1k0 yeah. what happened after s1? Ken got smacked with nerfs and ryu did too

[4:02:36] <Fukiaex> i legit uninstalled SF5 cause i didnt want to intall that 16gb patch
[4:02:37] <Raynys> basically she's a female version of Ken, right? LUL
[4:02:40] <kingofrogs> that doent look plus
[4:02:40] <YouKnow232> it's not safe
[4:02:43] <DevSF4> Mine is 16.5 on PC
[4:02:44] <yunggrasshopper77> I haven’t seen any Hondas
[4:02:47] <Llesor> LUL
[4:02:47] <Aspyre_FGC> Mod or ban
[4:02:50] <Janthai> @DevSF4 i think it is related to the engine, they have to patch the whole game
[4:02:50] <daMuffinMan007> LUL
[4:02:57] <EasXL> Above all else, she looks fun af
[4:02:58] <kingofrogs> im not saying you are a liar, im just saying u are lying
[4:03:00] <tisnomad> quotes on that
[4:03:00] <IZicken> she doesnt have counter hit weakness on her run lol
[4:03:02] <wackotaco13> Jebaited
[4:03:05] <blood_wizardd> LUL
[4:03:08] <yunggrasshopper77> Based on the trailer Honda looks solid.
[4:03:09] <YouKnow232> EX run stop might be safe though
[4:03:10] <sa1k0> hey, I thought you were a MK11 streamer, Vesper! PixelBob Kappa
[4:03:29] <giefreplays> not the whole game but any pak file that was modified has to be redownloaded entirely
[4:03:31] <Joiztik> 8th i think
[4:03:33] <machriphi> It's because of the way compressed .pak files work in Unreal Engine. You need to recompile the files so you have to redownload the game.
[4:03:33] <NurseLee> Aug 13th i think
[4:03:35] <daMuffinMan007> aug 8 th
[4:03:36] <Bunky0696> Aug 13th
[4:03:42] <daMuffinMan007> oh... oops
[4:03:47] <015kirb> i@kingofrogs it's part of the patch once it's installed it can't be redownloaded, I have to reinstall the game again. I've already done that
[4:03:50] <DevSF4> Vesper baited the MK community now they are forced to watch SFV
[4:03:53] <C_Sixty_Jam> I do

[4:11:25] <yunggrasshopper77> Honda finally!
[4:11:30] <RobZOObie> Im quite sure you can slide his wheelkick since hes grounden even tho it looks like he would be airborne
[4:11:33] <cpcp3> honda BegWan costume <3
[4:11:34] <EasXL> @sonic_sol what do you think about Poison so far, that clip looks nasty
[4:11:45] <GaleXylo> YOLO Honda's
[4:11:50] <cpcp3> ?
[4:11:51] <coffeethat> Hey @VesperArcade, sorry if someone already asked this, but are you going to try out Honda at any point?
[4:11:52] <muenshter> LUL
[4:11:58] <giefreplays> lol
[4:12:02] <angry_capitalist> I managed to make the shoulder -2 by spacing it but i don't think you can do it by cancelling a normal just raw run/shoulder
[4:12:03] <rashidoo> u challenge my alfa status
[4:12:04] <daMuffinMan007> netcode improvements Kappa
[4:12:13] <Superpattz81> LUL
[4:12:24] <GaleXylo> Honda theme causes lag WutFace
[4:12:24] <thehonorableryu> Honda wearing clothes? WutFace
[4:12:26] <machriphi> @EasXL She seems pretty good. She's got range, AAs, Damage, corner carry, oki. The only thing that's not too impressive are her VTs aren't robbery, but I also didn't lab them extensively.
[4:12:29] <Technonecro> Lag op
[4:12:33] <yunggrasshopper77> Her fireball hits moves that are projectile invincible. I couldn’t tatsu through it.
[4:12:38] <itsakili> The netcode patch
[4:12:43] <Kumikones> can't update the netcode man, it'll hurt the balance of the game for the cpt Kappa
[4:12:47] <cpcp3> hundred hand slap please PunOko
[4:12:49] <Vzu_> is her slide safe ?
[4:13:01] <치엇69> Wait that’s an invc reversal?
[4:13:14] <MetalxOath> @Vzu_ if spaced correctly yes
[4:13:22] <EasXL> @machriphi any guess on which VT you think'll be better based off what little you did lab? I'm gonna just throw a blind one out and say the command grab one
[4:13:26] <rashidoo> lmao
[4:13:31] <Croc_Boi> Poison was my main in SF4...can’t wait to play her in 5
[4:13:32] <mofaseni> are the new characters free
[4:13:38] <muenshter> no
[4:13:43] <muenshter> they're not free
[4:13:44] <yunggrasshopper77> @vzu_ her slide is not safe
[4:14:00] <ikarithewarrior> balance update?
[4:14:01] <coffeethat> Why would the new characters be free lol
[4:14:04] <Vzu_> Poison is my new love
[4:14:06] <yunggrasshopper77> But not easily punishable
[4:14:06] <EasXL> @ikarithewarrior nope
[4:14:13] <muenshter> they've only ever had free trial with sakura for arcade edition
[4:14:26] <mofaseni> ok thx let me guess they 5 dollars a piece @muenshter
[4:14:27] <Panik64> that Honda outfit is sick
[4:14:28] <치엇69> Frame data out cool
[4:14:28] <ZyxWhitewind> s3 characters are free atm
[4:14:46] <ikarithewarrior> what the update is about so ?
[4:14:47] <muenshter> 6 dollars a piece aren't they?
[4:14:55] <Forticon> @mofaseni $5.99 each or $14.99 if you buy them as a pack
[4:14:58] <EasXL> just characters
[4:14:59] <suk2lik> Beside Urien and Akuma all others dlc characters are pure trash.Makoto should be in this game .
[4:15:01] <Vzu_> all i know is after playing mk11's BS for so long SFV feels smooth AF LUL
[4:15:05] <mysteriousmentor> Please stop using E honda please he is a cancerous character i cant breath lol!

[4:15:33] <yunggrasshopper77> No I’m going to go check out the notes.
[4:15:36] <ikarithewarrior> this is bs then coz we used ti have caracter every 2 month
[4:15:38] <Superpattz81> Raggo Honda
[4:15:39] <machriphi> @EasXL Yeah, I think so, but I've been messing a bit with the molotov one, and you can build up a bunch of grey health that doesn't scale. So maybe there's good pressure sequences where you can keep them burning

[4:16:52] <Hartisas> Law respected monkaS

[4:17:40] <sonic_sol> https://clips.twitch.tv/SavageBreakableTrollNotLikeThis
[4:17:41] <thehonorableryu> How many people knew who Lucia was before the SFV announcement?
[4:17:44] <RobZOObie> @VesperArcade will lucia beat akkumas air fireballs ? her mid and hard dp are projektile and mid air immune !
[4:17:56] <ustinodj> honder is so fucking stupid haha
[4:17:58] <rashidoo> st. fierce is THE button
[4:17:59] <Blacque> Lucia's trials aren't to hard to get either
[4:18:07] <OneAboveAllAD> @VesperArcade what time is the bundle available?
[4:18:11] <Joiztik> MK DP
[4:18:14] <machriphi> Are anyone's trials hard to get through?
[4:18:18] <Llesor> @ustinodj haha :)
[4:18:22] <Besmir_t> @VesperArcade is this the European friendly stream?
[4:18:24] <yunggrasshopper77> @vesperarcade did you do her trials?
[4:18:24] <freakyyyy8> Now I just got it
[4:18:30] <ZyxWhitewind> not on ps4 though i think
[4:18:34] <machriphi> @thehonorableryu Final Fight 3 dog
[4:18:36] <MetalxOath> Lucia can EX DP Akumas fireball
[4:18:38] <Mantiskilla78> @thehonorableryu im sure quite a few people did. i still have my FF3 snes cart somewhere packed away from when i was younger
[4:18:42] <Joiztik> Hard part about poison is the whip cancel
[4:18:47] <yunggrasshopper77> Not on ps4 tho
[4:18:48] <InfectedJazz> I bought the bundle on ps4. EU tho so maybe not in US?
[4:18:48] <MikaiGamer> Poison is a better Falke
[4:18:52] <Wutevadude> right
[4:18:55] <BloodTideSGM> Poison has this crappy animation cancel with one of her moves that's kind of a pain in the ass
[4:18:56] <Llesor> yeah, the whip cancel hurts my hands
[4:19:01] <machriphi> Poison doesn't really play anything like Falke.
[4:19:10] <MikaiGamer> she does
[4:19:12] <Vzu_> @Joiztik how is it hard you press a kick LUL
[4:19:18] <MikaiGamer> and she has that stupid thing like her too
[4:19:26] <Llesor> she's a lot more closer to menat than falke
[4:19:30] <Llesor> or dhalsim
[4:19:32] <MikaiGamer> her whip is part of her hurt box stupid decision
[4:19:52] <machriphi> Literally every character ever with a weapon has a hurt box on it except for Menat.
[4:19:59] <Llesor> ^
[4:20:03] <thehonorableryu> @Mantiskilla78 @machriphi Yeah, I played FF3 with my brother a lot when it came out, still have the cart in storage somewhere. I was surprised to see her in SFV because I felt like only a few people knew who she was :D
[4:20:04] <yunggrasshopper77> I feel like Poison has her own identity
[4:20:04] <Vzu_> whipe is fast enough kinda hard to punish
[4:20:07] <ikarithewarrior> like ryu s fireball on start up
[4:20:08] <MetalxOath> @MikaiGamer to be fair if it wasn't she'd be retardedly strong
[4:20:09] <Vzu_> whip*
[4:20:13] <Croc_Boi> @mikaigamer who poison?
[4:20:15] <aitch2o> How is run slide?
[4:20:18] <015kirb> $5 for a character with 2 additional skins is a reasonable price. you also have to consider it has new assets, new animation, music, dialogue. you could spend hundreds of hours playing the same character learning and discovering new things. it's a lot better than fallout 76 "skins" which is just a paint, that cos $10. or call of duty shovel that cost $20
[4:20:19] <StevenAitsover> wats the next cpt premier event?
[4:20:20] <rocwell9> how plus is s mp?
[4:20:27] <emp_general_tso_chicken> @VesperArcade thoughts on Poison?

[4:21:27] <retrosense> female cody? or rashid?
[4:21:36] <mr_salmankhan> If Bonchan wins the Capcom Cup, thats like half a mil dollar right there
[4:21:40] <Joiztik> female ken
[4:21:43] <Vzu_> Poison's vt2 is kinda OP tho
[4:21:45] <Mantiskilla78> @thehonorableryu yeah you could be right. FF3 was kinda of a good game that was late in snes lifespan
[4:21:53] <machriphi> @015kirb No one seems to have an issues spending $20 for a skin in Fortnite that doesn't effect the game at all, but $5 for a brand new character that changes the game is too much apparently.
[4:21:56] <StevenAitsover> were there any ryu on top 128 at evo?
[4:21:56] <LurkNazMonster> POISON FEELS LIKE A ZONER
[4:22:02] <LurkNazMonster> sorry aall caps

[4:24:26] <MetalxOath> Does anyone know if the costume code works for any of Lucias costumes?
[4:24:29] <Mantiskilla78> lucia vt2 is definitely better imo but man vt1 can do some dmg

[4:25:49] <Llesor> @MetalxOath nostalgia she removes her jacket, summer she just goes to an actual bikini
[4:25:59] <machriphi> @that_lnsomniac_zack I don't get why people say it's so hard, you just press K to cancel it...
[4:26:03] <Llesor> just play matches I guess
[4:26:14] <Llesor> and hopefully you'll get out of the softban
[4:26:28] <Llesor> pretty sure you can only play against other RQers
[4:26:28] <rashidoo> armor fucks poison up
[4:26:30] <AdmiralAckbars_Snackbar> they should have called her baton vtrigger "police brutality"
[4:26:32] <that_lnsomniac_zack> @machriphi and you have to hit confirm afterwards
[4:26:37] <MikaiGamer> do lobby matches count towards it?
[4:26:41] <ustinodj> @rashidoo I think kolin poison is one of the worst MUs in game
[4:26:43] <itsakili> @machriphi alright thanks
[4:26:48] <ustinodj> you can probably imagine why
[4:26:49] <Mantiskilla78> the shoulder cancel she has is actually good meta in FF3. can do some mad stun combos with her once you get it down
[4:26:59] <Mantiskilla78> cool that they have that in this
[4:27:05] <Llesor> @MikaiGamer dunno, unfortunately
[4:27:24] <aitch2o> How many cops does SFV have?
[4:27:26] <Kibosh_Kaibutsu> yo, poison super cancel heavy, it sick
[4:27:35] <Llesor> whoooo
[4:27:36] <xcarbn> does her battle costume have an alt?
[4:27:41] <BloodTideSGM> Lucia = Ken + Sakura love child.
[4:27:43] <Llesor> that was sick
[4:27:45] <StevenAitsover> vt2
[4:27:50] <MikaiGamer> its hard to find any info reason i asked in here already told my room mate to just play on his own account and stop rq'ing if he wants to find actual games
[4:27:59] <fr0nnz> did she have 3f?
[4:28:04] <ZyxWhitewind> v2
[4:28:08] <DSan117> Gg’s VesperArcade that was me
[4:28:09] <bananeeFTW> i gotta say, hondas story mode is the best thing ever LuL anybody played it yet??
[4:28:09] <renanlindner> @VesperArcade Hello! Are you really enjoying Lucia??
[4:28:16] <MetalxOath> @Llesor Thanks!
[4:28:22] <Llesor> np

[4:28:47] <Mantiskilla78> @BloodTideSGM her character moveset are actuallymore inline with a combo of Guy and Maki from Final Fight
[4:28:47] <StevenAitsover> ...
[4:28:50] <ZyxWhitewind> damn it vesper
[4:28:53] <ZyxWhitewind> read
[4:28:56] <M4rk0r> you think capcom knows what they are doing?
[4:28:57] <ustinodj> I really wanna learn this MU
[4:29:02] <Llesor> vesperRage
[4:29:18] <wackotaco13> LUL
[4:29:31] <machriphi> This dude is GODLIKE
[4:29:34] <machriphi> Kappa
[4:29:40] <rashidoo> the crazy thing is i can always pull out +5 ob buttstomp
[4:29:41] <aitch2o> What kinda Karin players?
[4:29:43] <Shajita> That laugh kinda says it all, don't it?
[4:29:49] <rashidoo> cant keep this gorilla out
[4:30:09] <MikaiGamer> so the news for nov n dec is gonna be the last 2 characetrs for the season
[4:30:40] <machriphi> @MikaiGamer Nov is probably the last characters and Dec is probably a patch
[4:30:44] <MetalxOath> Hopefully Nov is last 2 characters so that Dec can be S5/SF6
[4:30:55] <Shajita> At this point, I'm just ready for new systems/moves or SF6
[4:30:58] <AlCampy> @VesperArcade Try to do some MP bHP xx EX run P, bHP run P, MP bMK Vskill/EX Tatsu, might give a reason for the shoulder
[4:30:58] <Kumikones> the negative edge is fucking me up and i keep accidentally getting her command dash over other stuff
[4:31:00] <RobZOObie> @VesperArcade is her fireball startup simmilar to ed and you can get hit inbetween ?
[4:31:10] <machriphi> Why do people think we're getting SF6. Why would it come out on the PS4 when PS5 comes out a year later.
[4:31:12] <gailardia_galan> SF6 is not coming out any time soon.
[4:31:19] <ustinodj> NotLikeThis
[4:31:39] <emp_general_tso_chicken> capcom fighting games are going to be in for a rough time the next few years honestly
[4:31:50] <emp_general_tso_chicken> who knows when SF6 and MvC4 are coming out
[4:31:50] <Moobot> Join the Vesper Arcade Discord at https://discord.gg/esjX5km
[4:31:55] <cjGRAYSON> 12 startup
[4:31:56] <AlCampy> @VesperArcade it stuns, and dHP run is a perfect meaty setup making shoulder +10 (yes it's D not B, my bad)
[4:32:02] <gailardia_galan> there will be no MvC4
[4:32:08] <ustinodj> "Oh ustin is thinking about playing a character? Lets make them ass!"
[4:32:08] <cjGRAYSON> ex shoulder is -8
[4:32:12] <GaleXylo> - everything
[4:32:16] <gailardia_galan> Capcom and Marvel do not want to do business with each other any time soon.
[4:32:17] <angry_capitalist> i think it's like -8 for ex shoulder
[4:32:23] <A4QThaGawd> ex shoulder is -8
[4:32:32] <Varodor> MvC4 in 10 years... maybe
[4:32:35] <daMuffinMan007> MVC4 within the next 2 years, guaranteed
[4:32:42] <GaleXylo> Kanzuki waifu theme!
[4:32:43] <daMuffinMan007> too much money on the table not to
[4:32:43] <itsakili> Mvci is so good, why make a marvel 4
[4:33:02] <rashidoo> yeet
[4:33:03] <gailardia_galan> @damuffinman007 shall we put money on that?
[4:33:04] <Kumikones> i like that her target combo doesnt whiff at max range
[4:33:15] <daMuffinMan007> @gailardia_galan let's go Kappa
[4:33:16] <RobZOObie> that ult looks so good
[4:33:22] <fluffysheap> Capcom only needs marvel to provide the license function, they could just make the same game with Capcom all srars
[4:33:26] <gailardia_galan> you would be stupid if Marvel is willing to risk the high they are on to do another MvC game
[4:33:46] <emp_general_tso_chicken> Capcom doesn't seem like they've even started thinking about SF6 tbh
[4:33:47] <MetalxOath> Honda is +5 but Lucia is -8, wtf lol
[4:33:47] <gailardia_galan> it would profit both marvel and Capcom to do their own separate games
[4:33:56] <emp_general_tso_chicken> It wouldnt surprise me if MvC4 just never happens
[4:33:57] <daMuffinMan007> you know how much money they make off that franchise? they would never let that go LUL
[4:34:07] <BiscuitTricks> there's still money there
[4:34:10] <aitch2o> Do random frame trap super.
[4:34:13] <gailardia_galan> MvCi says otherwise.
[4:34:13] <daMuffinMan007> 2 years guaranteed, it'll be back
[4:34:17] <Shajita> It is pretty insane how ArcSys has two games down the pipe for next year, but Capcom apparently wants to wait for new consoles...
[4:34:25] <ZyxWhitewind> vesperChair vesperChair vesperChair
[4:34:33] <daMuffinMan007> they sold 1 mil copies of MVCi, that's 400 milliion, approx.
[4:34:35] <gailardia_galan> $100 right now muffic
[4:34:40] <cpcp3> ps5 KonCha
[4:34:41] <daMuffinMan007> half a billion dollars ain't enough?
[4:34:41] <gailardia_galan> muffin*
[4:34:42] <ZyxWhitewind> going to get some kawfee vesperCoffee
[4:34:48] <Aristruefan> difference is nobody plays Arc games LUL
[4:35:02] <FalcieGaiah> arcsys has just been releasing games non stop tbh. Still haven't played their kill la kill game tho
[4:35:06] <ustinodj> FUUUUUK MEEEEE
[4:35:09] <emp_general_tso_chicken> @Aristruefan nobody played tekken either yet the game has grown massively in the last 3 years
[4:35:15] <rashidoo> FOREVERRRRRR
[4:35:16] <MetalxOath> Is EX tackle even worth it? I feel like you get more damage from the normal one since EX tackle air resets
[4:35:23] <Renpool> When did Akuma break his nose? Jk
[4:35:27] <NaughtyJuri> I don't want anymore Marvel especially Disney just gonna force the MCU crap and not what the fans want. Just make great capcom games like CVS3 or All Star capcom etc
[4:35:28] <emp_general_tso_chicken> the new GG has a good opportunity to grow a lot
[4:35:28] <daMuffinMan007> @gailardia_galan you're opinion is valid, don't get me wrong, i just think they'll give it one more shot before they call it quits for good
[4:35:30] <AlCampy> @VesperArcade you can do a setup after the stun on ex run
[4:35:34] <daMuffinMan007> your*
[4:35:36] <ZyxWhitewind> VTRIGGER 2!
[4:35:38] <Varodor> Rival Schools will be next capcom FG

[4:35:48] <spliffy_baz> vt2
[4:35:55] <cpcp3> WutFace
[4:36:00] <emp_general_tso_chicken> Capcom wont be making any fighting games for a long time lol. Capcom makes all their money from Monster Hunter, Resident Evil and DMC
[4:36:29] <TheXIIKing> stop talking like you work for Capcom and speak to Capcom higher ups @emp_general_tso_chicken
[4:36:30] <daMuffinMan007> yea, but they put the Mon Hun guy in charge of fighting games now, so they obviously have plans @emp_general_tso_chicken
[4:36:34] <LurkNazMonster> that fang skin....ewww
[4:36:43] <itsakili> Capcom might make a monster hunter 2d fighter pamaSIP
[4:36:44] <MetalxOath> o thats just fang in general
[4:36:46] <MetalxOath> ewww
[4:36:52] <gailardia_galan> @damuffinman007 I would LOVE to see another MvC game. but honestly, both of them need to get their head out of their asses. they made a game, it was disliked and then they DROPPED it. no support, nothing. no changes. NOTHING. that is fucked up
[4:36:53] <Varodor> Super SFV for PS5
[4:37:00] <Aspyre_FGC> LUL
[4:37:04] <giefreplays> LUL
[4:37:19] <AlCampy> the fake super silver is here Kappa
[4:37:20] <machriphi> Yeah, Capcom also through a ton of money into their esports division development and what other games do they make that are esports besides fighting games?
[4:37:25] <rashidoo> :O
[4:37:29] <daMuffinMan007> @gailardia_galan i agree man, it was a major fuck up.. but i got hope ya kno? and i'm thinkin they'll give it another shot for money-sake
[4:37:38] <KomradeKontroll> Megaman Battle Royale Kappa
[4:37:38] <machriphi> They're definitely going to work on new fighting games, but nothing is coming out on the current console generation, that just doesn't make any sense.
[4:37:58] <Shajita> @machriphi Depending on how Teppen works out, quite literally nothing. Fighting games are their entire Esport-scene
[4:38:07] <daMuffinMan007> yea, everything they got planned fighting game-wise will be next gen
[4:38:08] <LurkNazMonster> m and h dp for her are fireball immune right?
[4:38:11] <emp_general_tso_chicken> i mean their big reveal for SF5 after 8 months was 3 characters. it seems to me that the capcom fg division doesnt have much of a budget to work with
[4:38:13] <gailardia_galan> If they do, then they better listen to fans. it seems like they just don't care about MvC since quite a few years
[4:38:21] <Llesor> vesperRage
[4:38:26] <NaughtyJuri> @machriphi DMCV,RESIDENT EVIL sold a lot they have tons of ips they making money on
[4:38:29] <AlCampy> not even a combo @VesperArcade LUL
[4:38:30] <daMuffinMan007> yea, i agree with you guys
[4:38:33] <giefreplays> LUL LUL
[4:38:33] <emp_general_tso_chicken> E3 2020 will be interesting though
[4:38:34] <voIt_r> @voIt_r is new here. Say hello! VoHiYo

[4:38:40] <jejune21> LUL
[4:38:42] <machriphi> @NaughtyJuri I know, but what does that have to do with what I said?
[4:38:43] <NaughtyJuri> @machriphi not to mention RE3 Remake is in the works
[4:38:46] <emp_general_tso_chicken> If Capcom announces no new fighting games at E3 2020 then RIP
[4:38:55] <TheXIIKing> they never really toted this reveal as a huge, earth shattering reveal
[4:38:59] <daMuffinMan007> @emp_general_tso_chicken yea, then we might need to worry
[4:39:03] <TheXIIKing> the community just always jumps to conclusions
[4:39:06] <daMuffinMan007> but i'm sure they will
[4:39:07] <machriphi> @NaughtyJuri Are those Esport games? I'm not sure what you're saying to me.
[4:39:22] <rashidoo> listen, i aint a pervo, but goodness those thighs are...a lot
[4:39:26] <ZyxWhitewind> vesperScratch vesperScratch
[4:39:28] <daMuffinMan007> LUL
[4:39:30] <Shajita> At least both of the new consoles will have a lot of backwards functionality, so theoretically, they could release for multiple platforms with cross-play
[4:39:31] <RanHibiki > That cross-up hit box looks pretty good
[4:39:33] <emp_general_tso_chicken> @daMuffinMan007 we should start panicking if they reveal no new fighting games at e3 or capcom cup 2020 LUL that's when it's really RIP
[4:39:38] <budafuka> coward
[4:39:44] <voIt_r> Does Lucia have a DP ?
[4:39:44] <killacam0824> good shite
[4:39:47] <stickykilkenny> bullyvesper
[4:39:52] <TheXIIKing> @rashidoo it doesn't make you a "pervo" to appreciate something you're attracted to
[4:39:52] <daMuffinMan007> @emp_general_tso_chicken yea, then i'll be like... "fuckkk.... it's over... " LUL
[4:39:53] <machriphi> @NaughtyJuri I said that Capcom put a bunch of money into their esports development division this year. I asked what games they make besides fighting games that are esports. Then you said MH, DMC, and RE.
[4:39:59] <emp_general_tso_chicken> @daMuffinMan007 LUL
[4:40:00] <itsakili> E3 basically didn’t happen this year MaxLOL

[4:40:44] <NaughtyJuri> @machriphi esports doesn’t sell games just help the tournament scene that’s it really don’t want all Capcom games going esports
[4:40:48] <yunggrasshopper77> Even on lower level Fang is annoying lol

[4:42:30] <machriphi> @NaughtyJuri Yes, but again, why would they put together a new division for esport and dump way more money into it if they have no plans to have any esports games...
[4:42:31] <daMuffinMan007> Fang's super is the absolute worst LUL
[4:42:32] <killacam0824> fangs an a$$ hole

[4:42:58] <FalcieGaiah> @VesperArcade You have some resets like ex shoulder into cr.mk into meaty shoulder (-1), but I still think it's a waste of meter.
[4:43:00] <AdmiralAckbars_Snackbar> vt1 better
[4:43:01] <Llesor> I think VT1 is cooler
[4:43:02] <Kumikones> tonfa is easier to use, and easier to activate

[4:47:37] <ZyxWhitewind> we needed ... streams
[4:47:50] <stickykilkenny> Ultra silver ! LUL
[4:47:57] <shinzo1987> her oki isnt great so using kicks means you have to oki after the hard knockdown
[4:48:02] <itsakili> 5am here
[4:48:02] <IGrimNinja> This guy @vesperarcade out here gate keeping these poor silvers tsk tsk lol

[4:48:55] <Varodor> respect the low PunOko
[4:48:55] <exgleipnir> that accent is so dope though
[4:48:56] <lordmargarita> Ed and Ken also have a similiar hk. And I think her overhead is identical to sagat's

[4:49:32] <spliffy_baz> east coast so uptight
[4:49:34] <NaughtyJuri> Noticed Capcom didn’t announce season pass 3 and supposedly there was more announcement
[4:49:37] <IveSeenFootageIStayNoided> i miss the flag of imperial japan on the wall
[4:49:42] <exgleipnir> right now the tier list says otherwise

[4:50:44] <exgleipnir> oh so shes like cody mixed with guy
[4:50:45] <jlocke714> there is no main...only ZUL!

[4:51:40] <gailardia_galan> ^
[4:52:08] <shinzo1987> trying to resist the urge to quote monty python
[4:52:13] <exgleipnir> a white knight is loved by commoners a black knight is favored by queens just the way my dude
[4:52:15] <gailardia_galan> lmao
[4:52:20] <rashidoo> I BELIEVE
[4:52:23] <rashidoo> I CAN FLY
[4:52:25] <RobZOObie> kk just asking cause it said you can cancel vskill out of firball
[4:52:26] <exgleipnir> yo this alex does not give af
[4:52:30] <UchihaJUP> Maybe it's cause he has peach fuss for facial hair.😂
[4:52:41] <exgleipnir> lol he does not givew a f
[4:52:49] <fluffysheap> so is Honda stage viable online or is it still training stage only for sanity
[4:52:50] <Goodpart> none of the new three seem terribly strong. think i can pretty safely skip these chars
[4:52:59] <Llesor> good night everyone
[4:53:04] <exgleipnir> training stage is awesome night yo
[4:53:05] <rashidoo> cya llesor
[4:53:07] <machriphi> @Goodpart You're only interested if they're strong?
[4:53:13] <exgleipnir> honda is gonnna be strooooong
[4:53:19] <gailardia_galan> a tier whore
[4:53:22] <gailardia_galan> how nice
[4:53:24] <ustinodj> @VesperArcade I dont think me or rashidoo are feelin poison vesperShade
[4:53:28] <exgleipnir> machipri witness the process of tier who*ing
[4:53:28] <Varodor> all new chars is top 3
[4:53:33] <shinzo1987> wait I should only play string characters? oh my god ive wasted 2 years playing juri!!!
[4:53:34] <TheXIIKing> @goodpart must be sad to only care if a character is s tier and not if you actually enjoy playing as them faults and all
[4:53:35] <Goodpart> @machriphi no, but they gutted poison's gameplay and she plays nothing like she used to
[4:53:36] <accureye> i personally like Poison but i need to work on keeping pressure when the situation calls for it
[4:53:37] <Wutevadude> everytime i play alex on my bronz.... errr platinum badge ppl hardly rematch
[4:53:39] <EasXL> Honestly with characters like Laura and Zangief making Top 8 at EVO, I think it's more important to just play who you like
[4:53:41] <AlCampy> @VesperArcade lucia got some 50/50 on the stun, and damage seems decent
[4:53:41] <Meelosh> @Meelosh is new here. Say hello! HeyGuys
[4:53:41] <machriphi> @Goodpart What's it matter if they're strong if you're an online scrub?
[4:53:41] <itsakili> I kids like her super, ice and quick
[4:53:49] <rashidoo> did u do her trials ustin
[4:53:54] <ustinodj> most of em
[4:54:02] <exgleipnir> wait until tiers become irrelevant lol that is if they give 3 cas and 3 v triggers
[4:54:04] <rashidoo> reee
[4:54:07] <exgleipnir> tiers will go out the window
[4:54:10] <LiIyPad> is she worth getting?
[4:54:13] <ustinodj> She has really stupid hard cancel that is too hard to use in matches
[4:54:14] <gailardia_galan> @goodpart so gutting her gameplay automatically makes her bad?
[4:54:18] <ustinodj> You have to stance cancel
[4:54:25] <IGrimNinja> @vesperarcade poisons vskill in’s proj inv and I’m pretty sure her far vt2 command grab is too so I mean, I think Lucia is probably the worst of the 3 and she seems solid
[4:54:32] <lordmargarita> I like that poison can do all sorts of wild feints with her whip. Seems like she'll be fun to play mind games with
[4:54:33] <Wutevadude> that was a long time ago though
[4:54:36] <exgleipnir> gallardia never bother digging holes with a tier who*e
[4:54:41] <exgleipnir> theyll bury you in it
[4:54:43] <Goodpart> no but it makes her uninteresting: so if she isn't strong or interesting then...?
[4:54:48] <gailardia_galan> lol
[4:54:48] <exgleipnir> then after theyll fall in
[4:54:49] <RetroFGC> I like her default costume just wish you can remove the stupid socks. PunOko
[4:55:02] <exgleipnir> the socks are dope though
[4:55:09] <shinzo1987> tier lists shouldn't ever matter until you are literally playing in tournaments or in the top 500 of cfn
[4:55:13] <AlCampy> RetroFGC using a weab emote against weab socks, that's painful to watch LUL
[4:55:15] <machriphi> @Goodpart I personally think she's way more interesting that she was before. She was one of the most boring characters in 4. Also she seems pretty decent. Good range, really good damage, corner carry, anti airs, tick throws, oki. The only thing she's missing is a robbery VT.
[4:55:17] <Goodpart> i enjoyed her projectile setups and i like rekka characters. they took them both away along with her DP Kappa
[4:55:19] <exgleipnir> tired of the ridiculously short shorts and thigh crap just give a chick a legit costume call it a day
[4:55:24] <killacam0824> dem LEGS ResidentSleeper
[4:55:30] <Varodor> socks VoHiYo
[4:55:31] <exgleipnir> not just hey we are gonna call it a costume but its actually a who*es uniform
[4:55:32] <RetroFGC> I have no other emotes lol
[4:55:35] <gailardia_galan> as far as I remember, Poison in 4 was pretty uninteresting. just projectile zone until the opponent makes a mistake. how is that more interesting? @goodpart
[4:55:36] <Renpool> Socks are too short :)
[4:56:01] <exgleipnir> hes trying to say poison was high tier and trying to rationalize it so he doesnt look like a tier who*e
[4:56:02] <emp_general_tso_chicken> LOL
[4:56:07] <Renpool> Poison wasn’t as fun in 4... much better meow
[4:56:10] <exgleipnir> yeah this alex is nuts
[4:56:11] <emp_general_tso_chicken> RIP winstreak LUL
[4:56:14] <shinzo1987> Poison has a good choice in vtriggers both offer something different
[4:56:14] <AlCampy> a lucia tree
[4:56:16] <TheXIIKing> the only interesting thing about sf4 poison was her fireball game, and I mained her in 4
[4:56:21] <rashidoo> THE button
[4:56:24] <AdmiralAckbars_Snackbar> @VesperArcade youll land on a twitter highlight reel now
[4:56:24] <Goodpart> she had insanely strong footsies and really fun gimmicks. she was basically a more versatile shoto with nonlinear setups
[4:56:26] <Varodor> l love socks and the law VoHiYo
[4:56:26] <PaperSpy111> wakeup chop, the most galaxy brained LUL
[4:56:29] <exgleipnir> ima name the tree robert
[4:56:36] <sinho737> @sinho737 is new here. Say hello! HeyGuys
[4:56:37] <gailardia_galan> lol
[4:56:40] <exgleipnir> robert the tree
[4:56:47] <killacam0824> everyone's v trigger offers something different
[4:56:50] <Goodpart> she's the first main from 4 that's made it to 5 so i was excited, but... yeah
[4:56:52] <cbascombe242> Is the character summer bundle out as yet?
[4:56:53] <jlocke714> 45 minutes left on the update ammoYoda
[4:57:00] <exgleipnir> i just wanna see this ale parry for 70% damage
[4:57:00] <Renpool> Who cares what she does in her free time... all that matters is fighting skills
[4:57:07] <machriphi> @cbascombe242 It's been out on Steam for a while, no idea about PS4.
[4:57:13] <IGrimNinja> If a character has 900 or 950 they shouldn’t have a 3 bar vtrigger they should just have 2 2 bar ones cause by the time you get it your dead
[4:57:17] <exgleipnir> well if she dont fight in her free time her skills probably suck
[4:57:22] <exgleipnir> pun intended
[4:57:25] <Goodpart> lucia looks like she plays like dollar store guy. not sure if that's accurate though
[4:57:26] <cbascombe242> ok
[4:57:28] <itsakili> Poison pantyhose looks great pamaBLUSH
[4:57:30] <that_lnsomniac_zack> @jlocke714 seagulls hum stop it now strangeNo
[4:57:35] <XxjxriahxX> Where to watch the vod of top 8
[4:57:42] <exgleipnir> @IGrimNinja ay thats pretty intelligent tbh
[4:57:48] <PaperSpy111> lucia is almost peter the cop, if u think about it Kappa
[4:57:53] <machriphi> @Goodpart Yeah, guys known for his fireball game Kappa
[4:58:06] <exgleipnir> she reminds me of eddy shoutouts to alpha 3 eddy
[4:58:09] <Varodor> top 8 on youtube SF channel
[4:58:18] <XxjxriahxX> Thanks
[4:58:19] <Shingo> @IGrimNinja she's built to use vskill in her combos to build it faster
[4:58:24] <Goodpart> run pressure, tatsu, side switch target combos -- that's guy homie
[4:58:25] <Renpool> Poison isn’t a cop. She’s a ... promoter...?!?!?
[4:58:37] <ZyxWhitewind> twitch archive work?
[4:58:43] <Goodpart> she loses flip elbow obviously but gains a fireball. not sure how that synergises
[4:58:45] <exgleipnir> since when did guy have a target combo that side switches...
[4:58:48] <exgleipnir> thought that was cody
[4:58:49] <killacam0824> chat which announcement was u more hyped for SwiftRage
[4:58:55] <machriphi> @Goodpart Yeah, but she had that in FF3.
[4:58:57] <exgleipnir> poisons a dude...
[4:58:57] <RanHibiki > @PaperSpy111 the tonfa animation is quite the same lol
[4:59:00] <rashidoo> that was new
[4:59:09] <Goodpart> guy's target combo can end in a throw too...
[4:59:14] <ZyxWhitewind> guy has target combo that switches in sf4
[4:59:15] <exgleipnir> sf6 announcement is gonna be dope next year
[4:59:17] <ustinodj> Its like juri vt2
[4:59:17] <wild_dog5> bring ur still online O_o :O
[4:59:21] <Varodor> "Capcom Fighters" have separated matches from top 8
[4:59:24] <exgleipnir> lol wait whut?
[4:59:32] <exgleipnir> is it the one into throw?
[4:59:37] <exgleipnir> oh that sorta side switch
[4:59:41] <exgleipnir> yeah i guess
[4:59:42] <ZyxWhitewind> lp, mp, hp, down hk
[4:59:51] <Wutevadude> @exgleipnir part of me wouldn’t doubt it, but i need more time to make sure
[4:59:56] <Renpool> The expanded universe has been erased...
[5:00:03] <Goodpart> all FF chars had that in FF, but cody didn't get a proper target combo until 5
[5:00:06] <machriphi> You know why Guy, and Cody, and Lucia have a target combo that switches sides? Because they're all from Final Fight where they had a combo that switches sides...
[5:00:28] <exgleipnir> did they?
[5:00:38] <Renpool> There’s a throw in there
[5:00:39] <exgleipnir> seriously did they though cuz i only played ff 1
[5:00:42] <killacam0824> I am inevitable (snaps fingers) YEET
[5:00:48] <Goodpart> they had it in FF1 too
[5:00:51] <Wutevadude> poison or juri
[5:00:57] <exgleipnir> oh yeah the throw
[5:01:06] <XxjxriahxX> Seperate vids for matches on Capcom fighters on YT
[5:01:07] <exgleipnir> i mean is that technically a side switch though
[5:01:09] <that_lnsomniac_zack> @wutevadude both strangeCool
[5:01:09] <Aiiml3ssTM> pkingNom
[5:01:18] <Goodpart> the translation of FF chars to SF has always been pretty cool
[5:01:23] <exgleipnir> cuz dont you just follow up with flip into crossup elbow anyway (ambiguous)
[5:01:26] <Renpool> Cody is lp lp lp and down lp
[5:01:28] <lejuanix> its a sagat a good champ for ranked?
[5:01:31] <exgleipnir> lol
[5:01:34] <Goodpart> if anything the outlier is SF4 cody
[5:01:37] <famousduce> The next street fighter better be on Xbox
[5:01:39] <exgleipnir> did you just call it a champion
[5:01:42] <Wutevadude> @that_lnsomniac_zack na... rarely
[5:01:44] <zeromezxc> thats a bit laggy LUL
[5:01:47] <exgleipnir> sagat is a king boi
[5:02:14] <exgleipnir> he punches tigers in the face

[5:02:15] <rashidoo> damaj
[5:02:23] <ustinodj> I think I need to spend meter on basically everything to make this work
[5:02:24] <rashidoo> axtually not that much nvm
[5:02:25] <Renpool> Xbox has killer instinct
[5:02:37] <rashidoo> yo ustin im sorry but my thumbs are killing me
[5:02:37] <exgleipnir> ^lol
[5:02:45] <exgleipnir> i made killer in a week in that game then dropped it forever
[5:02:45] <rashidoo> i cant anymore man lol
[5:02:47] <killacam0824> glacius my boy
[5:02:48] <famousduce> Not the same
[5:02:54] <exgleipnir> never played it since super nintendo
[5:02:55] <Goodpart> does that shoulder link to jab or is it just a hard commit?
[5:02:55] <ustinodj> you gotta 🦆 when you are winning vesperSpit
[5:02:57] <ustinodj> nah all good, ggs
[5:03:01] <rashidoo> ggs
[5:03:01] <ustinodj> fuckin falke 2.0
[5:03:05] <emp_general_tso_chicken> lul
[5:03:08] <that_lnsomniac_zack> LUL
[5:03:13] <rashidoo> feelsfalkeman
[5:03:15] <Kumikones> anyone know which dp strength is her proper anti-air?
[5:03:24] <exgleipnir> always light
[5:03:25] <rashidoo> i definitely have the MU advantage tho
[5:03:31] <rashidoo> no question
[5:03:32] <exgleipnir> if you gotta sk always use light dp
[5:03:48] <Goodpart> medium is the standard AA DP for basically all chars...
[5:03:49] <Renpool> The shoto king
[5:03:51] <wild_dog5> is she good? how would u rank the new characters?
[5:03:55] <Shingo> yeah it's medium lol
[5:04:03] <rashidoo> like i can imagine high level play where poison keeps me out, but one meter use ln reaction and im in that ads
[5:04:03] <exgleipnir> nah its light
[5:04:05] <rashidoo> ass
[5:04:10] <Goodpart> dude, you're wrong
[5:04:14] <Goodpart> medium is 100% it
[5:04:22] <UchihaJUP> Nah it's medium
[5:04:23] <Goodpart> maybe not for lucia, but for like 90% of the cast it's medium
[5:04:46] <rashidoo> and honda can play at a range where he can outpoke poison cuz her ranged normals are too bunk
[5:04:47] <Kumikones> lucia's anti air is light dp then?
[5:04:59] <Kumikones> ah, that's cool
[5:05:03] <Kumikones> thanks
[5:05:07] <exgleipnir> no probs
[5:05:19] <FulGear88> how do you buy the character will all their outfits ??
[5:05:29] <StrongestWoman> Nostalgia Costume for Lucia is best... she even has the terry bogard colors
[5:05:30] <xJerow> i hope c.viper comes next
[5:05:31] <FulGear88> so the new dlc ones
[5:05:36] <rashidoo> also i shouldve not used heavy palms cuz its -2 when i should be using light palms at +3
[5:05:39] <exgleipnir> never use mediums cuz if you miss the input you get a medium button and eat a combo regardless
[5:05:41] <Renpool> That’s totally guys hurricane
[5:05:51] <exgleipnir> with lights most of the time you can actaully still get an anti air
[5:05:51] <Goodpart> don't miss the input then
[5:05:51] <killacam0824> we need Dudley
[5:06:02] <Goodpart> light has no air invuln
[5:06:10] <killacam0824> or hope of humanity is lost
[5:06:13] <exgleipnir> it trades which gives you follow up
[5:06:14] <Goodpart> so unless you hit it super early you're gonna get tagged
[5:06:24] <exgleipnir> which id rather have than going all the way up then landing in your face
[5:06:26] <Renpool> No more boxers give us a 360 spinner
[5:06:27] <xJerow> @killacam0824 CViper, Dudley and Hugo or Oro, that would be cool
[5:06:29] <Goodpart> and tbh, if the opponent is jumping properly and hitting their airs deep, you won't get a choice
