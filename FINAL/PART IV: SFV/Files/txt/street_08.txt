[1:49:39] <oscarfp_> Who is in Team Japan and EU?
[1:49:49] <arcadeghost> I really think Deejay would work well in the SFV system, due to the modularity of his moves
[1:50:00] <Nightdawn1> I'm def getting Tekken 7 tho. Namco knows how to do reveals right
[1:50:03] <tretch> neuman and johnny on Japan
[1:50:13] <arcadeghost> he could do some crazy shit with d,u+P in SFV rules
[1:50:21] <leveluplive> https://matcherino.com/tournaments/18179
[1:50:23] <tretch> Takamura on EU
[1:50:53] <DefSauce> Capcom is doing a fine job of SFV version of characters in general @arcadeghost ‚Ä¶ for the first time, Bengus Alpha Sagat has competition for "best Sagat" with SFV
[1:51:08] <arcadeghost> right right

[1:51:21] <Nightbot> OC: smash.gg/wnfoc | Oakland: smash.gg/wnfoakland
[1:51:21] <Nightdawn1> ummm yeah...
[1:51:22] <The_battousai_x> Capcom is trying push out Ono
[1:51:35] <The_battousai_x> that's why the reveals were leaked
[1:51:39] <arcadeghost> @The_battousai_x hmmm I had suspected that
[1:51:59] <maestro_lobo> perfecto!
[1:52:18] <Potatoemanda> He‚Äôs one of the only people passionate about SF
[1:52:22] <Nightdawn1> No they were leaked because Capcom knew after so long a wait, those character would have been disappointments.
[1:52:26] <The_battousai_x> I was itching for a real spawn reveal from NRS
[1:52:32] <Jeffdiddy> @the_battousai_x you know it was steam that leak it right
[1:52:34] <oscarfp_> Vega
[1:52:37] <oscarfp_> PogChamp
[1:52:49] <Dalonomus> i see new characters happening in the backround!!!
[1:52:50] <Realtrigga> idom plays on pad?
[1:53:00] <The_battousai_x> Ono has had a worse wrap as years go on
[1:53:04] <Dalonomus> yea hes a pa boy
[1:53:07] <arcadeghost> OMG
[1:53:08] <maestro_lobo> hoh no not like this that laura is on fire
[1:53:08] <Nightdawn1> Not buying the whole Steam thing. *puts on Tinfoil hat*
[1:53:15] <leveluplive> https://matcherino.com/tournaments/18179
[1:53:26] <The_battousai_x> and he was fired from his position as eSports liason
[1:53:55] <Potatoemanda> Steam wouldn‚Äôt have put out an apology if they didn‚Äôt goof
[1:54:09] <randomdp> !uptime
[1:54:10] <tretch> they did say sorry
[1:54:11] <The_battousai_x> Capcom trying to push him out, and they took away the only thing he had which was reveals
[1:54:18] <maestro_lobo> not good
[1:54:20] <Nightdawn1> Again, not buying it. Inside Job
[1:54:30] <Jeffdiddy> @potatoemanda yup
[1:54:55] <arcadeghost> @The_battousai_x I'm not a gossip but just from camera appearances and online he doesn't seem comfortable in his role
[1:54:57] <The_battousai_x> no Ono "shoryuken" at the end of EVO in how many years?
[1:55:06] <Nightdawn1> 8 months for Honda, a Final Fight 3 girl most people don;t know about and an ugly Poison. People would have been pissed
[1:55:16] <Realtrigga> there was a shoryuken before top 8
[1:55:27] <tretch> people are always pissed
[1:55:29] <Potatoemanda> He did it this year lol
[1:55:31] <The_battousai_x> not from Ono
[1:55:32] <AlexIIDX> He did it b4 top 8
[1:55:40] <Realtrigga> it was from ono
[1:55:44] <spiritjkd> he did it last year too i thought
[1:55:49] <shinyakimura> Whaaat
[1:55:58] <shinyakimura> That was some ST Claw stuff
[1:55:58] <maestro_lobo> lovely
[1:56:07] <The_battousai_x> it's always at the end with the next content
[1:56:11] <DtownDub> evo19Mindblown
[1:56:12] <DefSauce> great time for Capcom to drop another anime movie with shower scenes now, great cast to work with
[1:56:21] <The_battousai_x> this year's end was so abrupt and disappointing
[1:56:23] <FlashyFlash> poison not ugly ashlolAYAYA
[1:56:23] <Jeffdiddy> @the_battousai_x you got no clue what you talking about lol
[1:56:36] <The_battousai_x> you right mate
[1:56:57] <Jeffdiddy> he did it before top 8
[1:56:58] <mistermoustachio> Some people just salty SF didn't close out EVO this year, too
[1:57:06] <leveluplive> https://matcherino.com/tournaments/18179
[1:57:16] <Jeffdiddy> dint do it at the end because sfv wasent the last game this year
[1:57:17] <maestro_lobo> poison not ugly poison is bae okay?
[1:57:23] <mistermoustachio> Whatever has the most entrants should close out EVO, makes sense they changed it.
[1:57:26] <Nightdawn1> That was betrayal on Mr. Wizards part, IMO. But business is business, i guess
[1:57:26] <tretch> Idom confused
[1:57:43] <arcadeghost> holy crap

[1:57:51] <AlexIIDX> I dont see the big deal in closing the tournament
[1:58:01] <Nightdawn1> Still Smash Top 8 was hype. MK LEO is the GOAT
[1:58:21] <arcadeghost> I slept good for 4 hours ResidentSleeper now I'm here with ya'll Kappa
[1:58:22] <The_battousai_x> mkleo taking it after reset was hype
[1:58:39] <iPonzuSauce> 6 straight games
[1:58:42] <Mr_skinner_> smash is boring cuz u knew leo would win
[1:58:51] <The_battousai_x> was there a umvc3 salty suite?
[1:59:04] <VTriggered612> no disrespect to Smash but no one who commentates smash could close it out like Chen and Killian could. I'd even be fine with Aris and Markman
[1:59:09] <arcadeghost> Smash too complicated for me NotLikeThis I won't waste anyones time trying to figure it out
[1:59:16] <Nightdawn1> Tweek looked like he was running away with it, then Leo got mad PogChamp
[1:59:25] <mistermoustachio> Not really a Smash fan, but EVO the fighting game championship, not a Street Fighter championship, so I'm still fine with how it turns out.
[1:59:26] <Healpear> aris atpGasm
[1:59:26] <The_battousai_x> Killian didn't even want to be there

[1:59:54] <tretch> Brian tall AF
[2:00:09] <arcadeghost> @tretch yeah he pretty tall
[2:00:45] <Nightdawn1> From what I saw, Leo is one of the few players that knows how to comeback in Smash after having high damage.

[2:02:07] <Christan5> My favorite moment was Harada trolling us
[2:02:07] <BSBen> evo19Death
[2:02:14] <SammyKiller> Idom is a beast dude
[2:02:16] <softym> Pokchop winning a round using only Negan's d2 was the most hype moment Kappa
[2:02:17] <mistermoustachio> Yeah the new GG was tight looking, can't wait for more actual footage of it. I like the Tekken-esque looking Stage changes from Ringouts
[2:02:17] <Nightdawn1> was*
[2:02:23] <timbob> New GG, looks gorgeous. I would be more hype for KOF, but no trailer.
[2:02:28] <Atticist> Fighting games are something so great.

[2:04:40] <The_battousai_x> I'm not getting gran blue
[2:04:41] <tretch> GG....yes
[2:04:42] <Nightdawn1> maybe, GG3 kind of killed the hype for that game. sadly

[2:04:52] <The_battousai_x> I'll get GG
[2:04:58] <arcadeghost> dat old black Wang atpCarl
[2:05:04] <Christan5> So many good players didn't make it to top 8 this year though
[2:05:22] <Nightdawn1> that;s a good thing. True Evolution
[2:05:23] <DefSauce> street fighter has outlived so many other FGs that tried all sorts of gimmicks
[2:05:23] <Shadowdragon899> DTN runback PogChamp
[2:05:28] <arcadeghost> @Christan5 if you mean Tekken the scene is rough now
[2:05:30] <The_battousai_x> killers everywhere
[2:05:32] <mistermoustachio> It's 2020, so probably late 2020. Doubt that shit comes out Q1. You'll have no Arc game to play for awhile if you don't get Granblue.
[2:05:33] <leveluplive> https://matcherino.com/tournaments/18179
[2:05:38] <arcadeghost> @Christan5 even without upstarts like pakistan
[2:05:51] <SalvadorZombie> this is the first EVO that I missed 95% of
[2:05:56] <SalvadorZombie> and don't feel bad about it
[2:05:57] <Mr_skinner_> arslans domination made me like tekken less. running over the korean gods of the game like nothing ruined the mystique
[2:06:10] <The_battousai_x> this evo wasn't the same as the past
[2:06:19] <Christan5> Nah from SF to tekken a lot of of the common top 8 players didn't make it @arcadeghost
[2:06:19] <BattleAngel_IO> @Mr_skinner_ hahaha
[2:06:24] <SalvadorZombie> Wizard's gone full sell-out
[2:06:31] <unemployed_bum> LUL
[2:06:37] <Christan5> But that's what evo does
[2:06:40] <exgleipnir> wizards been full sell out
[2:06:44] <Christan5> Salvador PogChamp
[2:06:51] <exgleipnir> soon as they whispered in his ear $$$ it was over
[2:06:57] <SalvadorZombie> "We're the biggest fighting game tournament. Also, here's a non-fighting game closing the weekend."
[2:06:58] <arcadeghost> @Christan5 yeah its true in SF too man, I thought Infexious would be good when he was playing grapplers a couple years ago but didn't expect him to be top 8
[2:07:00] <xGenetik> wotc?
[2:07:01] <The_battousai_x> worst evo for reveals
[2:07:01] <Nightdawn1> Arslan winning was the feel good story of EVO. Its nominated for an Oscar. Don't @ LUL
[2:07:01] <exgleipnir> mena so angry lol
[2:07:04] <FlashyFlash> at least bonchan finally won an evo ashlolAYAYA
[2:07:06] <exgleipnir> just gonna go ham salad
[2:07:06] <leveluplive> https://matcherino.com/tournaments/18179
[2:07:07] <DefSauce> only thing ppl talked about was pay F to pay repsects
[2:07:08] <The_battousai_x> best evo for upsets
[2:07:12] <exgleipnir> best evo in years though
[2:07:18] <arcadeghost> ^^^
[2:07:20] <exgleipnir> perfect run by bonchan
[2:07:25] <SalvadorZombie> @exgleipnir I SERIOUSLY doubt that
[2:07:36] <SalvadorZombie> "my guy won" =/= "best EVO"
[2:07:36] <FlashyFlash> infexious screen goof up LUL
[2:07:40] <duffcitytrunks> How much are the characters
[2:07:43] <arcadeghost> after Lowhigh won Tekken last year I think Evo is definitely the wildcard of tournaments for those who are able to attend
[2:07:43] <Moobot> Follow @levelupseries @TheAlexValle for news on upcoming events, streams, and special announcements!
[2:07:46] <BattleAngel_IO> @exgleipnir facts!
[2:07:50] <Christan5> @arcadeghost Its because someone turned him into a robot but wasn't able to download everyone
[2:07:55] <exgleipnir> salvador zombie i seriously doubt youve been watching evo for that long
[2:07:56] <Shadowdragon899> Shoutouts to Tio Valle for making Top 8 in Samsho
[2:08:02] <BattleAngel_IO> @duffcitytrunks $15 for all 3 I think, the pack comes out tomorrow
[2:08:04] <The_battousai_x> nobody said that salvador
[2:08:07] <exgleipnir> dont lie.
[2:08:11] <DefSauce> free wins, games are on a different level
[2:08:12] <Nightdawn1> Glad Bonchan finally got his EVO win, but kind of sad for Punk at the same time.
[2:08:16] <Christan5> @flashyflash icey23Heart
[2:08:22] <whereischarlesIee> that snake tease was just an injoke by the stream team FeelsBadMan
[2:08:28] <PlatinumGNG> @The_battousai_x Overall you're right, but some players are really excited right now: Samsho, T7 and Soul Calibur players in particular
[2:08:30] <exgleipnir> bonchan literally reminded everybody the strength of skill lol
[2:08:30] <arcadeghost> alright Mena
[2:08:31] <nyan3air> evoKO
[2:08:33] <arcadeghost> is that Sami
[2:08:35] <SalvadorZombie> @exgleipnir Yeah? Weird. I've been on Twitch since 2010 and I've been watching Evo on here since it started.
[2:08:38] <exgleipnir> ay how mad is mena though lmao
[2:08:40] <FlashyFlash> @Christan5 jinxbeWave
[2:08:40] <SalvadorZombie> evo16MindBlown
[2:08:40] <H2ONaCl> mena is too good
[2:08:45] <maestro_lobo> do not count my boy mena out
[2:08:49] <Dao_Puppy> Laura's fireball should hit low, damn the consequences.
[2:08:56] <exgleipnir> since 2010? lool
[2:09:06] <BattleAngel_IO> MenaRD is a strong player, he just gets bandwagon haters
[2:09:08] <Shadowdragon899> Bonchan using the KING atpGasm
[2:09:08] <SalvadorZombie> KOF13 was always the best tournament at EVO
[2:09:09] <Mr_skinner_> brainf PogChamp
[2:09:22] <bmaccc91> Birdie beats Laura tho also
[2:09:26] <tonycrust> Yeah MenaRD is great.
[2:09:27] <The_battousai_x> samsho was my favorite top 8. Infiltration vs ZJZ was wild. timer stop at 0 through rage explosion twice
[2:09:28] <Mr_skinner_> he gets haters because he hasnt really won anything since capcom cup
[2:09:34] <SalvadorZombie> I said I've been on TWITCH since 2010, kiddo. Not watching EVO since 2010.
[2:09:43] <EggmaniMN> twitch launched in 2011 though
[2:09:50] <Nightdawn1> Speaking of upsets who saw an American winning BBTag against some of the best Japan Anime players. That was epic.
[2:09:50] <SalvadorZombie> Mena gets haters because of his attitude
[2:09:50] <maestro_lobo> @battleangel_io that is so true
[2:09:56] <Christan5> @arcadeghost But what was more stressful for you the top 32 trying to qualify for top 8 or the top 8
[2:10:01] <exgleipnir> i dont remember them broadcasting it on twitch in 2010.
[2:10:10] <exgleipnir> but aight if you say so, i wonder who streamed it
[2:10:12] <SalvadorZombie> @EggmaniMN look up Justin TV
[2:10:13] <pnw_rikioh> @the_battousai_x Yeah 0 seconds lasted 20 seconds at least LOL
[2:10:15] <arcadeghost> @EggmaniMN I wasn't around, but I think Twitch exited in some form before that (Justin TV)
[2:10:16] <FlashyFlash> nobody was awake for bbxtag Kappa
[2:10:22] <SalvadorZombie> I've been on Twitch SINCE THE START.
[2:10:26] <The_battousai_x> wild right?
[2:10:28] <perfectstranglers> samsho best top8 evo
[2:10:31] <exgleipnir> lol nobody cared about tag after sfv
[2:10:36] <nikkojisan> @nightdawn1 WHICH American
[2:10:37] <Temujin9000> MenaRD is awesome, his only mistake was taunting our lord and savior Daigo
[2:10:43] <BattleAngel_IO> @SalvadorZombie I feel you on that, he does put out a negative vibe sometimes but he honestly is a cool person
[2:10:49] <SalvadorZombie> I definitely need to go back and watch the SamSho Top 8
[2:10:50] <Nightdawn1> @FlashyFlash 4Head, you might be right. I watched the playback
[2:10:54] <exgleipnir> ay salvador, didnt twitch start under a different company name before it was called twitch
[2:10:55] <Dym_06> I'm gnot a gnelf
[2:10:57] <Christan5> Mena is a good guy
[2:11:00] <whereischarlesIee> nikkojisan shinku
[2:11:01] <exgleipnir> lies are funny...
[2:11:07] <exgleipnir> mena is so angry tonight
[2:11:08] <The_battousai_x> samsho top 8 was pretty good
[2:11:09] <SalvadorZombie> BattleAngel_IO maybe, I just don't like him though, nothing against him personally
[2:11:13] <BattleAngel_IO> @SalvadorZombie BRO!! Samsho was hype!!!
[2:11:15] <exgleipnir> lol mena is playing angry af
[2:11:18] <FlashyFlash> Nightdawn1 so did I 4Head
[2:11:19] <mistermoustachio> He said he was on twitch since then, not Evo streamed it then. But you're both dickdragging about watching Evo and ya both prolly trash, so chill LUL
[2:11:23] <BattleAngel_IO> @SalvadorZombie I can respect that
[2:11:25] <Temujin9000> But Daigo forgives his sin, so Praise Be
[2:11:31] <arcadeghost> I didn't see SamSho :-(
[2:11:34] <maestro_lobo> @salvadorzombie im thinking your just jelous my dude
[2:11:45] <exgleipnir> @mistermustachiou yeah thats why i sorta didnt say anything after
[2:11:48] <SalvadorZombie> mistermoustachio oh I'm DEFINITELY trash at fighting games LUL
[2:11:49] <Nightdawn1> I won't spoil for won it then
[2:11:55] <Nightdawn1> who*
[2:11:59] <Temujin9000> @arcadeghost that was a sin not watching Samsho top 8
[2:12:08] <exgleipnir> who won tekken was it jeonding?
[2:12:10] <Mr_skinner_> brian G not ready
[2:12:12] <FlashyFlash> guy above already spoiled it LUL
[2:12:13] <Temujin9000> Samsho was hella hype
[2:12:14] <exgleipnir> or did he get eliminated early
[2:12:14] <SalvadorZombie> @Nightdawn1 I don't really care about that, I missed it, fair play
[2:12:17] <arcadeghost> @mistermoustachio not sure who you're referring too but you're quite the charmer Keepo
[2:12:19] <BattleAngel_IO> I will say MenaRD put Birdie on the map in a big way
[2:12:24] <exgleipnir> nice camera
[2:12:28] <arcadeghost> @exgleipnir Pakistani Arslan
[2:12:33] <10stringcheese> HotPokket
[2:12:38] <Shadowdragon899> Coaching atpRtsd4
[2:12:40] <exgleipnir> ARSLAN WON IT AGAIN???
[2:12:45] <SalvadorZombie> Mena didn't put Birdie on the map, Birdie was already big before he started cheesing with him
[2:12:50] <exgleipnir> no fuc*ing way did he use mama mishima?
[2:12:51] <arcadeghost> Arslan has never won
[2:13:05] <Nightdawn1> Yeah, MenaRD don't deserve the hate he gets.
[2:13:07] <exgleipnir> tokido and infiltration put birdie on the map in the beta
[2:13:07] <arcadeghost> KappaHD
[2:13:09] <The_battousai_x> Arslan best tekken player proven tonight
[2:13:11] <Temujin9000> @SalvadorZombie Mena put Birdie on the map
[2:13:17] <exgleipnir> cuz he was considered ridiculous cuz nobody had fought him since alpha 3
[2:13:20] <leveluplive> https://matcherino.com/tournaments/18179
[2:13:21] <Shadowdragon899> He won Evo Japan and no Evo
[2:13:22] <maestro_lobo> @salvadorzombie tipical hater just descrediting people of theyr acomplishments
[2:13:23] <SalvadorZombie> Temujin9000 sorry, but no
[2:13:25] <exgleipnir> mena didnt put birdie on the map lol
[2:13:28] <whereischarlesIee> jp evo and evo prime winner arslan ash PogChamp
[2:13:30] <Shadowdragon899> now*
[2:13:35] <DefSauce> being the first Warlord Juri, think it feels good?
[2:13:38] <OriginalSaltySavage> this is a hard 6-4 for birdie.
[2:13:39] <exgleipnir> evo 2k16 every tourney before that everyone had a pocket birdie
[2:13:46] <arcadeghost> @exgleipnir who put birdie on the map
[2:13:49] <SalvadorZombie> @maestro_lobo hater? discrediting? Mena's a great player, but others were playing Birdie way before he was even on the scene
[2:13:59] <BattleAngel_IO> @SalvadorZombie tech was very different, I personally saw the tech change up while in Japan for a project, people changed how they played, he put Birdie on the map
[2:14:00] <exgleipnir> tokido and infiltration during the beta for sfv
[2:14:03] <Temujin9000> give him the credit, he beat Tokido, the greatest SFV player at Capcom cup, don't make shit up
[2:14:04] <exgleipnir> i already said that lol
[2:14:07] <10stringcheese> Imagine unironically caring about SFV LUL
[2:14:08] <arcadeghost> @exgleipnir "pocket" birdie is not "tournament winning" birdie Kappa
[2:14:17] <exgleipnir> everyone had a pocket birdie in 2016. everyone
[2:14:19] <cpcp3> PunOko
[2:14:21] <OriginalSaltySavage> the original mena tech Kreygasm
[2:14:25] <SalvadorZombie> BattleAngel_IO we'll just have to agree to disagree
[2:14:29] <DefSauce> marked for death
[2:14:31] <exgleipnir> @arcadeghost ima let you just dig your hole
[2:14:40] <exgleipnir> mena is playing angry af
[2:14:40] <FlashyFlash> y ppl putting poor birdies in their pocket WutFace
[2:14:43] <Nightdawn1> Mena still won EVO but making one of the best comebacks in FGC history. Hating won't change that. Cant call it Fake News 4Head
[2:14:49] <SalvadorZombie> Temujin9000 the only one making shit up is you
[2:14:50] <exgleipnir> ay what makes this matchup 6-4 against birdie
[2:14:56] <arcadeghost> @exgleipnir I'mma ignore your ass (btw I played birdie in 2016 Kappa)
[2:14:58] <arcadeghost> Kappa
[2:15:04] <OriginalSaltySavage> k o
[2:15:05] <BattleAngel_IO> @SalvadorZombie bet, now go check out SamSho top 8 when you can, you won't regret it my guy, it's worth it
[2:15:06] <maestro_lobo> @salvadorzombie just accept that you are a very sore hater

[2:18:00] <Nightdawn1> Lucia is the only interesting thing about that reveal, and barely. Like I said, inside job on the leak NotLikeThis
[2:18:12] <I_Despise_Kids> @OriginalSaltySavage i know amirite
[2:18:15] <exgleipnir> @BattleAngel_IO i stopped playing sf when it got that bad with the tier whoring
[2:18:21] <cpcp3> sfv update 24.9gb cmonBruh
[2:18:21] <LaLiLuLeLolz> Inside job... from Steam....
[2:18:23] <LaLiLuLeLolz> Try again

[2:18:32] <maestro_lobo> im saying that damnd is being realesed in decenber mark my words
[2:18:43] <Dym_06> was isdd at evo?
[2:18:50] <Shadowdragon899> I was hoping the leak was a troll and there was another trailer..
[2:18:55] <exgleipnir> i stopped playing after that lol
[2:18:58] <nikkojisan> i found Poisons rework interesting. They lifted a lot of elements off of Whip from KOF, and I main whip.
[2:19:00] <BattleAngel_IO> @exgleipnir yeah it got real bad toward the end, like ChunYun 3S bad
[2:19:04] <exgleipnir> the tier list following got lame
[2:19:08] <I_Despise_Kids> I ain't gonna lie, Joker got that mean ass lineup. I'm jealous.
[2:19:11] <Nightdawn1> Lalilulelo disagreeing LMAO! now I seen everything in chat
[2:19:28] <exgleipnir> lol chunyun third strike was awful.... til kokujin and them started raging
[2:19:36] <OriginalSaltySavage> LUL if you stopped following sf after people started tier whoring that means when...alpha 2? 3s?
[2:19:42] <exgleipnir> chuns good? then i dont got a block button anymore, ima just parry and say screw it
[2:19:44] <LaLiLuLeLolz> What's sad is Capcom showed a good amount of stuff, and nobody cares cuz it was leaked
[2:19:48] <leveluplive> https://matcherino.com/tournaments/18179
[2:19:56] <arcadeghost> @nikkojisan a lot of people have compared SFV to KOF from the beginning
[2:20:00] <maestro_lobo> @originalsaltysavage lmqo
[2:20:06] <exgleipnir> @OriginalSaltySavage yeah you didnt read what i said so theres no point
[2:20:12] <exgleipnir> diggin these holes

[2:20:34] <exgleipnir> @BattleAngel_IO makoto is something to fear though in that game more than most
[2:20:36] <Temujin9000> Feels bad for Ono and crew if there were no leaks, it would've been hype af,
[2:20:38] <nikkojisan> they arr stylistically simialr games
[2:20:40] <exgleipnir> once she gets in its terrifying...
[2:20:40] <Nightdawn1> Now what sad is that Capcom made people wait 8 months for 3 characters after promising something big. Like I said, fans would have been pissed.
[2:20:42] <higa_hitori> „ÅÑ„Åë„ÉºÔºÅ
[2:20:43] <OriginalSaltySavage> capcom had the best release. 3 characters, available day of. tekken be like yeah my dudes u get one then gimme 6 months

[2:21:15] <nikkojisan> She does, it's clear Whips moveset inspired their changes to Posion
[2:21:16] <SouljaSleet> blazeblue was better @OriginalSaltySavage
[2:21:18] <arcadeghost> @OriginalSaltySavage Tekken is still bad ass right at this very moment atpCap
[2:21:24] <exgleipnir> lol af
[2:21:35] <higa_hitori> Â§ßË∞∑„Åå„Çì„Å∞„Çå„ÉºÔºÅ
[2:21:36] <DefSauce> that FB was nova, caved
[2:21:38] <Temujin9000> Idom is godlike with Laura but he has the personality of a wheat bagel
[2:21:40] <exgleipnir> tekken is starting its normal downturn
[2:21:41] <wakeuplan> SC finals were hype as hell
[2:21:50] <exgleipnir> especially since theyre getting a bit nonsense with the characters
[2:21:55] <exgleipnir> i mean lucky chloe was one thing but...
[2:21:58] <DefSauce> with EX meter
[2:21:59] <maestro_lobo> japan is taling this free
[2:22:08] <exgleipnir> otani is here?
[2:22:10] <exgleipnir> lolooooool
[2:22:12] <Temujin9000> He needs to be more like Justin or Fchamp (MVC3 days)
[2:22:13] <Nightdawn1> BlueGod is the best SC player in America, too bad he now the best in the world LUL
[2:22:17] <tonycrust> What downturn? Tekken is more popular than ever @exgleipnir Lololol
[2:22:20] <exgleipnir> otani alone could body the whole room
[2:22:25] <higa_hitori> „ÅÑ„ÅÑ„ÅûÔºÅ
[2:22:27] <nikkojisan> don't hate on Tekken, its hype as hell right now and not going anywhere
[2:22:31] <LaLiLuLeLolz> That kinda personality doesn't fit Idom
[2:22:33] <Temujin9000> If Idom started beef, he would be sponsored
[2:22:35] <exgleipnir> tekken is more popular than ever? i dunno about that one
[2:22:40] <bmaccc91> @temujin9000 ya 4real. But dude deserves to get sponsored. So many people want this dude to go to tournaments
[2:22:51] <arcadeghost> I'm watching SFV but waiting for Tekken player matches TriHard
[2:22:52] <exgleipnir> tekken always has its seasonal downturn happens with all fighting games
[2:22:53] <LaLiLuLeLolz> Plz... not every player has to be a beef starter
[2:22:59] <LaLiLuLeLolz> It'd be super forced
[2:22:59] <SouljaSleet> aye lucky chleo is great
[2:23:00] <Nightdawn1> Tekken is the most successful game this generation, but with casuals and in the tournament scene
[2:23:07] <The_battousai_x> tekken definitely more popular than its ever been
[2:23:09] <Nightdawn1> both*
[2:23:09] <exgleipnir> scrubs wash out as the game gets harder because people gets better nobody hated lol.
[2:23:21] <exgleipnir> sorta scummy to say its hate when someone says something you dont like but aight
[2:23:22] <higa_hitori> „Åå„Çì„Å∞„Çå„Éº
[2:23:26] <nikkojisan> Tekken is hard, its natural you wont like it if you dont put in the work and get wrekt by people with all the tech. Take your lickings and learn the game.
[2:23:26] <exgleipnir> whatevs its chill
[2:23:29] <Temujin9000> Idom is too nice and in this era, nice guys just don't cut it unless you're a japanese god
[2:23:35] <exgleipnir> otani gonna run a train on this room doe
[2:23:41] <exgleipnir> dude is a beas
[2:23:42] <Streetwize> FT What?

[2:24:24] <LaLiLuLeLolz> I just hope Viper comes back
[2:24:26] <Temujin9000> not enough to get 4th at evo, more people mention LTG than Idom
[2:24:31] <exgleipnir> i been around this game for 20 years... still dont know much lmao
[2:24:33] <LaLiLuLeLolz> Since they ruined Juri that's my only hope
[2:24:33] <arcadeghost> @Streetwize these are just fun matches
[2:24:47] <Streetwize> Alright

[2:25:08] <arcadeghost> Bornfree haHAA
[2:25:12] <higa_hitori> „Åå„Çì„Å∞„Çå„ÉºÔºÅÔºÅ
[2:25:12] <exgleipnir> otani about to show some tech
[2:25:14] <bmaccc91> 4th at Evo is definitely enough to get a sponsor
[2:25:19] <OriginalSaltySavage> idom lets his skill do the talking. there's not a pro in the US that doesn't consider him top 3-5 US players
[2:25:33] <LaLiLuLeLolz> Exactly saltysavage
[2:25:36] <Megasizer> UK won cus evo said Infexious won!
[2:25:44] <exgleipnir> idom really is a monster player and with laura thats saying somehting
[2:25:44] <maestro_lobo> idom is def a good player
[2:25:46] <LaLiLuLeLolz> There's some players that are personalities and there are some that just play the dam game
[2:25:54] <arcadeghost> INFEXIOUS WINS haHAA lol
[2:26:05] <exgleipnir> the personalities are starting to be the crap players now though
[2:26:05] <letteringsoll> „Åé„ÇÉ„ÅÇ„ÅÇ„ÅÇ„ÅÇ„ÅÇ

[2:27:31] <LaLiLuLeLolz> You really gonna tell me Du ain't a personality? You ever seen him interviewed? You ever seen the shenanigans between matches when he plays Smug?
[2:27:32] <Spartanrelic79> SeemsGood it‚Äôs all good, my ears are only bleeding a little bit. @leveluplive :D
[2:27:32] <exgleipnir> smug definitely isnt one of the top anymore
[2:27:33] <The_battousai_x> idom is a great player, certainly not to be underestimated
[2:27:33] <maestro_lobo> üòÜüëåüèº
[2:27:37] <exgleipnir> coolikid is leagues ahead of him

[2:28:21] <exgleipnir> jwong and strider def arent top 5 lol
[2:28:24] <freetwitchprimezulul> justin wong isn't a top sfv player
[2:28:32] <LaLiLuLeLolz> I dunno about wong
[2:28:33] <exgleipnir> du maybe but he fell off hard
[2:28:39] <arcadeghost> this chat Kappa
[2:28:42] <LaLiLuLeLolz> He's top5 personalities
[2:28:46] <exgleipnir> yeah jwong def not even close
[2:28:47] <Temujin9000> Du got personality tho, did u see him going WNF and NBLC and taunting the scene with his skills
[2:28:48] <OriginalSaltySavage> @exgleipnir year after year, getting into capcom cup says differently
[2:28:53] <letteringsoll> „ÅÑ„ÅÑ„Çà„Éº
[2:28:54] <bmaccc91> And idom beats strider and j wong
[2:29:01] <exgleipnir> i think they mixup personalities they like with actual skill a lot
[2:29:02] <maestro_lobo> how many costumes does chun allready have like 200
[2:29:07] <exgleipnir> cuz the people worship it happens
[2:29:13] <exgleipnir> idom easily wipes strider and wong
[2:29:17] <shinyakimura> tbh, I think Dual Kevin might be a top 5 US player now
[2:29:22] <LaLiLuLeLolz> I can't believe people forgot that Du was the dude that started the teabagging in tourney
[2:29:23] <BattleAngel_IO> @maestro_lobo right! she needs more tho!
[2:29:26] <exgleipnir> maybe if strider kept up his laura but he kept trying g and others out
[2:29:29] <LaLiLuLeLolz> Du is DEFINITELY a personality
[2:29:31] <TataJooma> Du & Punk are easily in the top three discussion.
[2:29:33] <exgleipnir> dual kevin is a demon at sfv
[2:29:34] <arcadeghost> wow setup
[2:29:35] <shinyakimura> Dual Kevin or JB are up there
[2:29:38] <exgleipnir> that was unexpected af and with rashid
[2:29:42] <The_battousai_x> DK has his hat in the ring
[2:29:44] <JoJTGT> I'm pretty sure that whiffed throw was a bait
[2:29:46] <arcadeghost> lol damn
[2:29:47] <exgleipnir> not du cuz he been slacking
[2:29:49] <fgcmorad> LUL
[2:29:53] <nyan3air> YOOOOO
[2:29:56] <OriginalSaltySavage> samurai in the top 10 US list for sure

[2:30:00] <arcadeghost> Shakz goin in Kreygasm DrinkPurple
[2:30:06] <exgleipnir> not americans but the JAPS
[2:30:07] <The_battousai_x> punk talks a lot of shit and then drops the ball
[2:30:11] <higa_hitori> „Åå„Çì„Å∞„Çå„ÉºÔºÅÔºÅÔºÅ
[2:30:12] <LaLiLuLeLolz> Yea I think samurai is top 5 in terms of skill
[2:30:32] <higa_hitori> „ÅÑ„ÅÑ„ÅûÔºÅ
[2:30:34] <exgleipnir> well cuz punk ends up being dace to face with tokiido and infiltration and that roundplay stuff dont work on them
[2:30:35] <Temujin9000> Idom is young, give him time, but it is sad that he's not sponsor and other non skill players are
[2:30:43] <exgleipnir> samurai is definitely a beas

[2:31:12] <freetwitchprimezulul> yet
[2:31:13] <LaLiLuLeLolz> Saying Punk "drops the ball" by losing to people like Tokido is just silly
[2:31:13] <exgleipnir> he just gets hit with the rando who picks a high tier and dont have to work, cant comprehend why tf theyre doing what theyre doing and they cant either
[2:31:14] <shinyakimura> What lol
[2:31:22] <leveluplive> https://matcherino.com/tournaments/18179

[2:31:48] <LaLiLuLeLolz> Exactly
[2:31:50] <exgleipnir> @arcadeghost yeah your comments do get stupid sometimes
[2:31:50] <The_battousai_x> punk drops the ball after he talks shit
[2:31:56] <OriginalSaltySavage> yeah people act like punk drowned facing some randoms
[2:31:57] <LaLiLuLeLolz> Is Punk bad for losing to itazan or Problem?
[2:32:02] <exgleipnir> itazan is playing gief doe
[2:32:02] <Temujin9000> I think this is the first year that Idom travel to tourneys beside defend the North
[2:32:07] <Nerrk> Norman from Japan
[2:32:09] <exgleipnir> and good giefs honestly scare karins
[2:32:13] <fgcmorad> Itazan beat him at Game over too, seems like he studied him
[2:32:14] <exgleipnir> hes got the parry now
[2:32:15] <LaLiLuLeLolz> Itazan is a maniac
[2:32:16] <OriginalSaltySavage> "Drops the ball" someone won 1k points and still has not caught up to punk. shut up wasteman
[2:32:21] <LaLiLuLeLolz> You can't blame anybody for losing to Itazan
[2:32:26] <cabecadeporcolol> @arcadeghost don't bother reading some of the stuff that goes around here, actually some eye cancer material here lol just mute
[2:32:28] <maestro_lobo> if people would donate as they talk and troll in the chat

[2:32:50] <exgleipnir> just sub to cross counter
[2:32:54] <The_battousai_x> maybe punk should be a little more humble then huh?
[2:32:56] <LaLiLuLeLolz> Bro Itazan beat Fchamp 2 sets, gief vs sim
[2:32:58] <LaLiLuLeLolz> That's crazy
[2:33:02] <The_battousai_x> I didn't say punk is traah

[2:36:36] <LaLiLuLeLolz> Dang that dude's hair is mad green
[2:36:47] <Panik64> graphics reactions PogChamp
[2:36:49] <BattleAngel_IO> @Temujin9000 I can see that!
[2:36:49] <LaLiLuLeLolz> Fchamp was playing Lucia earlier
[2:36:51] <exgleipnir> oscar what tourney you talkin about bud
[2:36:54] <tarantarantaran> johnny4actJohnny johnny4actDoba johnny4actDoba
[2:37:08] <exgleipnir> lucia? i can fuggin see him playing lucia too
[2:37:15] <icloudzero> Laura tough
[2:37:16] <oscarfp_> Literally what we watching a 3v3 lol
[2:37:17] <nyan3air> johnny4actJohnny johnny4actDoba johnny4actDoba
[2:37:21] <Temujin9000> Imagine if Daigo played Cammy or Rashid
[2:37:21] <exgleipnir> he likes redheadds doe
[2:37:25] <LaLiLuLeLolz> She's basically sim with options and a DP
[2:37:33] <exgleipnir> daigo did play cammy once i think
[2:37:34] <LaLiLuLeLolz> Lucia's slide is ridiculous
[2:37:46] <exgleipnir> she has a slide?
[2:37:58] <filthypotato> wheres puk, did he disappear after evo?
[2:37:58] <LaLiLuLeLolz> Yea, and it's dumb good
[2:37:58] <Moobot> Follow @levelupseries @TheAlexValle for news on upcoming events, streams, and special announcements!
[2:38:11] <exgleipnir> command slide or cr hk slide?
[2:38:12] <BattleAngel_IO> I'm gonna say it: Lucia is gonna be top tier! So top tier that they make Final Fight 4
[2:38:20] <exgleipnir> cuz if its a command slide yeah i can see it being dumb good
[2:38:26] <LaLiLuLeLolz> DF LK slide
[2:38:27] <exgleipnir> nah her damage is too low
[2:38:29] <LaLiLuLeLolz> It's fast AF
[2:38:30] <Temujin9000> I think our lord and savior said Cammy was too basic for him, he couldn't differentiate himself from other players
[2:38:31] <exgleipnir> wait...
[2:38:45] <exgleipnir> that shoulder she has can be followed up or it gives her reset opportunities so she may be high tier af
[2:38:49] <mapples> who else 4am east coast?
[2:38:51] <exgleipnir> the mind games will be real with her
[2:38:57] <fgcmorad> Among the 3 new char, Poison seems the strongest
[2:39:03] <The_battousai_x> east coast here
[2:39:05] <exgleipnir> df lk???? yeah that does sound like itll be dumb good for some reason
[2:39:10] <LaLiLuLeLolz> She's got some good stuff, but she's got some obvious weaknesses
[2:39:13] <higa_hitori> „Ç∏„Éß„Éã„Ç£„Å∂„Å§„Åë„Åü„ÇåÔºÅ
[2:39:17] <BattleAngel_IO> She will be my new Makoto, mixups for days...hopefully
[2:39:25] <LaLiLuLeLolz> Poison feels... I dunno
[2:39:25] <exgleipnir> i think honda is honestly the strongest of the 3
[2:39:30] <exgleipnir> he has an armored headbutt now
[2:39:35] <Temujin9000> I hope Capcom buff every all characters but keep Karin, Rashid, the same
[2:39:36] <maestro_lobo> @fgcmorad e honda gonna be top tier youll see
[2:39:43] <freetwitchprimezulul> poison is the strongest
[2:39:46] <Ê•µÂ∫¶‰πæÁá•„Åó„Å™„Åï„ÅÑ> „ÇÑ„Çã
[2:39:46] <exgleipnir> which was a runnning joke before but i cant believe they actually did give him some cheap shi* like that
[2:39:49] <BattleAngel_IO> @exgleipnir I'm hoping Honda is a monster, that corner carry potential, MUHGAWD!
[2:39:52] <freetwitchprimezulul> then honda then lucia
[2:39:54] <letteringsoll> „Çà„Åó„Çà„Åó
[2:39:57] <fgcmorad> Plz no, hate Honda NotLikeThis
[2:39:59] <LaLiLuLeLolz> I kinda agree. Honda seems the strongest of the three from the jump
[2:40:05] <exgleipnir> yeah buffing everyone will give hella hype to the game
[2:40:15] <LaLiLuLeLolz> That is to say, he seems the easiest to be effective with
[2:40:18] <exgleipnir> @BattleAngel_IO same plus his command grab carries hella now
[2:40:23] <exgleipnir> which is fuggin scary as is
[2:40:35] <exgleipnir> poison seems nerfed with no rekka
[2:40:39] <BattleAngel_IO> @exgleipnir facts tho!
[2:40:50] <tarantarantaran> NAISU johnny4actJohnny johnny4actDoba johnny4actDoba
[2:40:52] <higa_hitori> „ÅÑ„ÅÑ„ÅûÔºÅ
[2:40:54] <LaLiLuLeLolz> Poison is completely different from sf4
[2:40:54] <exgleipnir> so shes like whip from kof now
[2:40:55] <nyan3air> capcomOhohoho
[2:40:57] <LaLiLuLeLolz> No fireball, no rekka
[2:41:02] <BattleAngel_IO> I'm hoping Poison doesn't end up Falke tier on release
[2:41:09] <exgleipnir> yo if honda has an armored headbutt he can access outside of v trigger hes high tier from day 1
[2:41:19] <nyan3air> TAKAMURA evoHeart
[2:41:23] <LaLiLuLeLolz> I think Poison's VT2 has potential
[2:41:23] <Ê•µÂ∫¶‰πæÁá•„Åó„Å™„Åï„ÅÑ> johnny4actJohnny johnny4actJohnny johnny4actJohnny johnny4actJohnny
[2:41:24] <exgleipnir> poison wont cuz they basically copy pasted her from 4 it seems
[2:41:32] <exgleipnir> even her super is pretty much the same exact animation
[2:41:36] <maestro_lobo> e honda def is the g of this season
[2:41:37] <fgcmorad> Isn't armored heatbutt a VT only?
[2:41:39] <exgleipnir> her overhead kick is the same exact animation
[2:41:41] <LaLiLuLeLolz> Dude she's NOTHING like she was in SF4
[2:41:42] <BattleAngel_IO> @exgleipnir oooooh I hope so!
[2:41:49] <exgleipnir> poisons v trig 2 what was that one
[2:41:56] <LaLiLuLeLolz> Have you actually played her?
[2:42:05] <Juggernawwt> do they know theyre on levelup?
[2:42:08] <BattleAngel_IO> @fgcmorad I'm thinking it would be because the abuse ZOMG!

[2:42:18] <exgleipnir> oh of course her gameplay is gonna be different my bad on that but yeah
[2:42:24] <exgleipnir> nah not yet whats different about her
[2:42:29] <xsinkerboyx> Docta where did GhostChipz go?
[2:42:33] <fgcmorad> @battleangel_io yeah it would be busted
[2:42:34] <exgleipnir> is she still going for rekka pretty much 100% of the time?
[2:42:37] <exgleipnir> or is she a zoner now
[2:42:46] <BattleAngel_IO> @LaLiLuLeLolz so is she a total rework now?

[2:42:56] <leveluplive> https://matcherino.com/tournaments/18179
[2:42:58] <LaLiLuLeLolz> the only thing she has from sf4 is the flip kick
[2:43:02] <LaLiLuLeLolz> everything else is different
[2:43:05] <fgcmorad> She's like that whip user from Grandblue
[2:43:07] <LaLiLuLeLolz> no fireballs, no rekkas, no dp
[2:43:08] <9mmSpliff> yo yo
[2:43:19] <battlenetclient> its 1 in the west coast, crackhead hours

[2:44:03] <LaLiLuLeLolz> I honestly don't know, I just messed with her in training mode for like an hour
[2:44:11] <LaLiLuLeLolz> I don't really understand her gameplan
[2:44:23] <LaLiLuLeLolz> But she has way more range than she did in SF4 so I guess she can do a zoning game
[2:44:33] <tarantarantaran> PrideGive johnny4actDoba johnny4actDoba PrideTake
[2:44:39] <Megasizer> Lucia is the best new character
[2:44:43] <higa_hitori> „Éä„Ç§„ÇπÔºÅÔºÅ
[2:44:43] <exgleipnir> i got a feeling shes a long range punish character
[2:44:47] <exgleipnir> like a better dhalsim
[2:44:55] <LaLiLuLeLolz> I do think Lucia has a lot of potential
[2:44:59] <maestro_lobo> lucia is just female ken plz burn her with fire
[2:45:03] <exgleipnir> cuz if the whip is punishable like falkes stick was day 1 ima laugh
[2:45:11] <exgleipnir> only reason no one plays falke is that
[2:45:20] <exgleipnir> lucia has potential if we find out her shoulder resets
[2:45:25] <BattleAngel_IO> Poor Falke!
[2:45:25] <exgleipnir> cuz thats a 50 50 in itself
[2:45:27] <higa_hitori> „Ç∏„Éß„Éã„Ç£„Å∂„Å§„Åë„Åü„ÇåÔºÅ
[2:45:33] <exgleipnir> cuz she can follow up combo into jab from the shouler
[2:45:40] <BattleAngel_IO> just give falke a gun already
[2:45:41] <LaLiLuLeLolz> Lucia's fireball is the ticket. The setups are stupid
[2:45:43] <exgleipnir> or just sit there and let you beat yaself
[2:45:55] <maestro_lobo> are we gonna ignore that lucia is just female ken?...
[2:45:59] <exgleipnir> yeah they should just give her a gun so the tier followers play her
[2:46:00] <„ÉÑ„Ç§> johnny4actJohnny johnny4actA
[2:46:04] <higa_hitori> „Åå„Çì„Å∞„Çå„ÉºÔºÅ
[2:46:06] <fgcmorad> Yeah Lucia looks like an Oki monster a la Kolin
[2:46:14] <exgleipnir> she is sorta a female ken until she starts kicking grnades at you

[2:46:27] <LaLiLuLeLolz> She is kinda like Kolin
[2:46:29] <exgleipnir> 3s urien
[2:46:34] <LaLiLuLeLolz> In a bad way
[2:46:38] <oscarfp_> Bleach LUL
[2:46:45] <BattleAngel_IO> @exgleipnir hahahaha I see what you did!
