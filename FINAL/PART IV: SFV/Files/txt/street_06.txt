[0:03:32] <ShinobiAJ> the anti-fireball specials are usually just worse than jumping because the reward isnt nearly as good

[0:12:48] <Daveski_215> Since Lucia is New Yorican we can say those are PR colors :)
[0:12:52] <risemix> The more I see of this character the more I think she's sort of sf5 greatest hits version
[0:13:12] <someguy_zero> Lucia is the goddess of SFV Kreygasm
[0:13:15] <risemix> Like all your favorites are here: Ken kolin Sakura
[0:13:30] <Kumikones> So lucia’s only weakness is... no far reaching light buffer? lmao
[0:13:39] <yunggrasshopper77> @vesperarcade why you beating on our boy Mr Dark Hadou
[0:13:49] <risemix> I mean her ground game probably isn't that great at high levels

[0:15:28] <Miker1234> here we go, bullyArcade
[0:15:31] <8PoOryGone8> have you seen Desks combo video of Lucia?

[0:16:03] <Hotsaucenelly237> @blackcraftfgc ME TOO!
[0:16:11] <duck_helmet> Yay for Lucia!
[0:16:31] <raven_1991> is it asfe to say Lucia is the better character of the 3?
[0:16:35] <elliotterodriguez> let me just keep my comments to myself CarlSmile
[0:16:42] <elliotterodriguez> LUL
[0:16:55] <duck_helmet> Anyone know a good scrub crush counter combo for Lucia? Something easy I can do?
[0:16:56] <Magicjerryfresh11> Ryu army our early tonight???
[0:16:58] <bigdon2284> Desk combo vid for lucia is sick

[0:17:40] <yunggrasshopper77> @miker1234 nairoWaifu

[0:18:30] <ctrigger101> lucia looks like she has parkinsons.
[0:18:32] <MaiWaifuGaming> If only Lucia used a gun instead of playing pyromancer hacky sack lmao
[0:18:34] <intergalacticowl> i saw the best name for a smurf acct to play Lucia it was "ThiccKawfee"
[0:18:41] <jas_sam> opa tudo bom paulo?
[0:18:46] <PaulowebTV> @jas_sam olá
[0:18:59] <jas_sam> tu vai pro treta né?
[0:19:03] <duck_helmet> Played more SF5 tonight with Lucia than I've played in the last 4 months. That character is just fun.
[0:19:07] <PaulowebTV> @jas_sam n sei, to sem grana
[0:19:13] <intergalacticowl> @duck_helmet im garbage with her but she is SUPER fun
[0:19:16] <jas_sam> eu tbm .-.

[0:19:37] <jas_sam> mto longe de onde eu moro tbm,eu sou nordestino
[0:19:46] <risemix> Lucia looks fun but I think her design is a little bit boring.... Like, Honda is a sumo wrestler and feels like one, Lucia just has a bunch of random moves
[0:19:47] <jas_sam> moro na Paraíba ai n tem como ir
[0:19:53] <Kumikones> How difficult is poison?
[0:19:56] <darth_ukonou> it's better Alicia than Honda?
[0:20:12] <duck_helmet> Yeah, Honda def wins the looks badass award for sure.
[0:20:15] <yunggrasshopper77> @miker1234 thanks
[0:20:18] <jurifan22> did she just speak spanish???
[0:20:27] <elliotterodriguez> @vesperarcade why does she remind me of Viper
[0:20:28] <fighterinthestreet> Who do you think Lucia plays like the most out of the sfv cast?

[0:21:33] <CaptainMogu> Awww yeah. Lucia
[0:21:36] <mechak> @jurifan22 I think she's hispanic. I forget where but yes she uses spanish slang
[0:21:39] <MaiWaifuGaming> I honestly think the reason why people think Lucia looks plain is because she's the 6th blonde girl in the game
[0:21:52] <risemix> She's Puerto Rican
[0:21:58] <cool_vargas> crouching lp combos after the v trigger activation
[0:22:05] <Taglog7> Thigh-highs hi5
[0:22:08] <cool_vargas> *lk
[0:22:26] <risemix> Lucia has no identity of her own
[0:22:27] <yunggrasshopper77> I think the other color you was using was better.
[0:22:29] <hernansoltermann> Hi Vesper good night from Argentina
[0:22:39] <duck_helmet> Can people post links in here? Did a ryu sketch during EVO I thought I'd share.

[0:26:27] <Kid_Koopa> Ahh gotcha
[0:26:29] <yunggrasshopper77> Has to be a better color than this.

[0:32:32] <el_superking01> tiers wise i dunno...im going off my preferance LUL
[0:32:35] <soldieroftheempire> Hey Vesper is Lucia cheap or it's just people talking shit as usal?
[0:32:37] <Rioka> she has so many convertions bro omg im going crazy
[0:32:44] <risemix> Ken is better. Neither are good.
[0:32:56] <stickykilkenny> hi vesper !
[0:33:04] <ustinodj> ppl sayin her fireball is cheap
[0:33:04] <Moobot> Join the Vesper Arcade Discord at https://discord.gg/esjX5km
[0:33:04] <Darktree78> Top tier incoming!
[0:33:09] <YomoTheWanderer> ken has a special unga factor
[0:33:13] <hernansoltermann> Momochi now is play with Lucia
[0:33:15] <YomoTheWanderer> very unique
[0:33:17] <shujin21> system changes was needed not these final fight rejects lol
[0:33:25] <Guarddoge> normals too stubby to be top tier imo
[0:33:28] <Miker1234> i mean, i still thinking Lucia can be the new Ibuki
[0:33:32] <Miker1234> but idk
[0:33:35] <Miker1234> let's wait
[0:33:37] <Hotsaucenelly237> @vesperarcade You didn't mention Karin in that cheap list.
[0:33:44] <Kumikones> I get beat up by flowchart akumas in gold so i feel that cheapness
[0:33:50] <yunggrasshopper77> @vesperarcade since when did you become an Akuma hater?
[0:33:54] <risemix> Lucia is the kind of character that will have a bunch of ridiculous setups
[0:34:00] <Chicken_Curry_Rice> she got anything for really good projectiles?
[0:34:01] <solarxlipse> @bunky0696 wats up bunky
[0:34:01] <Darktree78> She has good shimmy punish potential imo
[0:34:07] <risemix> Akuma should be deleted
[0:34:24] <Remedy944> Karin is top 3.
[0:34:26] <someguy_zero> Dam i was web surfing and heard Guile's theme Kreygasm
[0:34:29] <clllp> lucia look mid high or top tier
[0:34:34] <risemix> Karin isn't too 3 lol.
[0:34:36] <yunggrasshopper77> @risemix then I would delete this whole game
[0:34:38] <YomoTheWanderer> ryu should be deleted too
[0:34:39] <MaiWaifuGaming> Does Lucia share the same voice actress as Juri?
[0:34:55] <Godzilla2> nope
[0:34:57] <Daveski_215> No, different voice actress
[0:34:58] <someguy_zero> Ryu will forever be S1 because he is a must in every new SF game
[0:35:08] <jurifan22> @VesperArcade so do you think your big patch prediction wont come true until capcom cup???
[0:35:30] <akinohamlet> imagine a street fighter with no ryu LUL It would get more hate than the first SFIII
[0:35:47] <MaiWaifuGaming> Oh okay, the more I hear her say "not bad" the more I think she sounds like Juri
[0:35:54] <YomoTheWanderer> i cant
[0:36:20] <Miker1234> @maiwaifugaming hear that quote she says on the slide, it sounds like juri there too
[0:36:21] <risemix> Is she in throw range after her v skill ender.
[0:37:03] <Stevercakes> Could they not have added a couple more voice lines for "NOT BAD"
[0:37:33] <ustinodj> netcode is RIP
[0:37:36] <Miker1234> 99% sure?
[0:37:39] <Miker1234> Kappa
[0:37:39] <MaiWaifuGaming> Man, I hate watching Guiles. He's a shell of his former self. It's like watching a washed up fighter trying to see if he still has it.
[0:37:47] <b_kaws2324> This game would be perfect for adon
[0:37:49] <hennesyhufflepuf> a lot of people are not bad
[0:37:52] <ustinodj> Lucia has really good blockstrings
[0:37:57] <hennesyhufflepuf> we need lines asap
[0:37:59] <hassan_72> i feel sorry for ryu users
[0:37:59] <hennesyhufflepuf> uhh
[0:38:01] <hennesyhufflepuf> not bad
[0:38:09] <pk_starstorm_1222_> Not Bad man Not Bad
[0:38:11] <ustinodj> @hennesyhufflepuf THERES NO ESCAPE
[0:38:11] <Guarddoge> the game has like a year and a half left. The netcode is not getting fixed
[0:38:18] <risemix> Lucia seems to have good pressure for sure
[0:38:31] <hennesyhufflepuf> @ustinodj that one pops up a decent amount too
[0:38:41] <Darktree78> That overhead fireball into slide combo is gonna throw off a lot of players
[0:38:57] <Remedy944> Just Pick Karin, throw out low forward, go make yourself a sandwich, then come back and you should still have another 2 minutes to confirm it.
[0:39:00] <MikeTales> People will figure it out eventually
[0:39:17] <ustinodj> @VesperArcade Hes playing organically Kappa
[0:39:31] <hennesyhufflepuf> all over the place or "formless" Kappa
[0:39:35] <hennesyhufflepuf> like water
[0:39:37] <pk_starstorm_1222_> Is Guile supposed to be an Airport attendant? SeriousSloth
[0:40:00] <MaiWaifuGaming> Guile is part of the Air Force
[0:40:03] <Kumikones> People are saying that her low forward is hit confirmable, but idk how easy it’d be to do that given how short it is
[0:40:05] <Haru1267> @Haru1267 is new here. Say hello! SeemsGood
[0:40:12] <ustinodj> @pk_starstorm_1222_ its a USAF uniform, which I am pretty sure airports copied

[0:40:23] <Kumikones> The range of the low forward i mean
[0:40:32] <ustinodj> @jurifan22 I wont say its cause ppl are playing chars they dont know, but vesperShade
[0:40:35] <el_superking01> Kappa
[0:40:39] <pk_starstorm_1222_> @ustinodj I thought so I knew it had to deal with the AF
[0:40:43] <DangalfTheKrey> @Kumikones i tried it. it's really hard.. not feasible in high pressure tournament setting IMO
[0:40:46] <jurifan22> @ustinodj LUL dick
[0:40:49] <Miker1234> what's USAF? Army Force?

[0:41:34] <hennesyhufflepuf> COMB THAT HAT
[0:41:36] <Miker1234> then ass works too Kappa
[0:41:36] <b_kaws2324> Adon would be a good addition to SFV

[1:08:23] <Nightbot> Okizamboney (ケツを食ベる) is a term used in fighting games to generally describe your wake up game. To be more specific, this is when players (professionals mostly) will set alarms to randomly wake up at odd hours of the night to play a match online before going back to sleep. The idea is to make yourself better while mentally exhausted, since tournaments can last as long as 48 hours without time for rest. -tsuchinokoDemon

[2:26:36] <cjGRAYSON> I mean a netcode would help
[2:26:39] <ustinodj> Good netcode? Impossible. Now only if they could buy GGPO...
[2:26:51] <jurifan22> what is that?
[2:27:02] <Subdued_subdood> I mean SF6 might have the netcode Capcom used for MvCI
[2:27:09] <dyslex666> "Bison just teleported when he dashed, fuck this netcode" - VesperArcade
[2:27:13] <dreamcankles> eins trigger too good Kappa
[2:27:15] <ustinodj> its a good netcode that capcom owns
[2:27:20] <cjGRAYSON> they COULD by ggpo, but they wanted to make their own
[2:27:25] <horseapples> get double helix on it ki netcode is actually amazing
[2:27:26] <cjGRAYSON> being cheap
[2:27:37] <giefreplays> they've got a third intern on sf6 dont worry

[2:39:40] <Flyawave> you're gonna be waiting a while fam
[2:39:42] <Efonzerellie> if you get hit during

[2:39:45] <The_Agonisttt> Oro will be so sick
[2:40:10] <Chicken_Curry_Rice> shoulder work?
[2:40:10] <MaximumEffor7> oro VT will be - unbind the 2nd hand
[2:40:17] <fuzzyrpg> go easy on me
[2:40:27] <yunggrasshopper77> @flyawave yeah till winter
[2:40:28] <Flyawave> if oro unbinds his dominant hand he'd fucking KILL people

[2:40:35] <Darktree78> Poison, aw yeah
[2:40:36] <Efonzerellie> I wonder if you can activate into something big

[2:41:57] <bounty_skull> I wonder what else
[2:41:58] <MaximumEffor7> ED Super is 5 minutes
[2:41:59] <ArmaIy> Not enough time for them to pull the ethernet LUL
[2:42:15] <GladiatorVS> I wanna see Dudley.
[2:42:16] <The_Agonisttt> Hugo would be cool, imagine Hugo vs Abi LUL
[2:42:19] <horseapples> people were like "her super's so boring" but damn people really into those two hour cinematic ones that get dull immediately?
[2:42:20] <Efonzerellie> Oro whipped my ass in 3rd strike
[2:42:22] <GladiatorVS> Hugo too
[2:42:25] <The_Agonisttt> Makoto or Dudley is pretty much certain
[2:42:32] <bounty_skull> yup
[2:42:56] <Darktree78> Gil for SF VI
[2:43:03] <xcarbn> poison and honda's super are weak
[2:43:17] <GladiatorVS> Yeah I don't really need a dame movie cinematic finisher. lol
[2:43:21] <spydermanga> "Flashy supers that are really short" Oh, like Ed's FailFish
[2:43:22] <Flyawave> Urine my way
[2:43:26] <The_Agonisttt> Honda feels so bad compared to SFIV
[2:43:40] <MaximumEffor7> Poison hard to play but very very strong
[2:43:47] <MaximumEffor7> As any zoner she is hard to play
[2:43:47] <Chicken_Curry_Rice> she is
[2:43:49] <The_Agonisttt> She has potential
[2:43:52] <MaximumEffor7> you need to have zoner mentality
[2:43:55] <hotdog_exe> poison has mad damage but is reaally hard to play

[2:44:48] <horseapples> poison has no overhead
[2:44:48] <GladiatorVS> Nope no over head
[2:44:55] <Chicken_Curry_Rice> no overhead but she has instant overhead lk
[2:44:58] <GladiatorVS> Yeah that ex was plus
[2:45:00] <The_Agonisttt> she has command throw tho, right?
[2:45:06] <kingdomkid7> the way vesper has been playing he'll probably make ultra diamond tonight lol
[2:45:06] <horseapples> vt2 is her command throw only
[2:45:10] <Flyawave> BIGGU LAGGU
[2:45:12] <St0n3b0n3> ono!
[2:45:14] <NinoDiablo> No overhead
[2:45:19] <xcarbn> @The_Agonisttt its her vt2

[2:45:34] <The_Agonisttt> after that ex
[2:45:35] <MaximumEffor7> VT1 combo to supper that its like 3-4 hits to special is 500 damage
[2:45:47] <BlackCraftFGC> Lucia Kahn

[2:46:17] <GladiatorVS> Poor Poison... She could have been way better..
[2:46:30] <NinoDiablo> Like Kage's EX axe kick
[2:46:33] <wilsonwrecks> Hey @VesperArcade ! How's the new characters? I feel like E.Honda is really good!

[2:47:14] <MaximumEffor7> How do people do poison stance cancel consistently ?
[2:47:16] <megatonbeef> Max isn’t in Mexico vesper will never get him
[2:47:16] <Loudpreditor> @VesperArcade What's your opinion on Lucia's VT1 vs her VT2?
[2:47:31] <yunggrasshopper77> You know how Max is, he will be there in 20 mins lbvs
[2:47:32] <solgen10> other than mike ross, no one played honda, why is he in there?
[2:47:34] <GladiatorVS> Yep very, very simple
[2:47:41] <GladiatorVS> Lol
[2:47:44] <I_nod_my_head_when_I_lose> Kappa
[2:47:47] <wilsonwrecks> Poison isn't, for sure. She's a "Menat/Dhalsim".
[2:47:52] <Deimos002> Kappa
[2:47:53] <megatonbeef> @maximumeffor7 Hold punch down as soon as you activate inexorably press Kim I
[2:48:06] <yunggrasshopper77> @solgen10 he is part of the original 8
[2:48:09] <I_nod_my_head_when_I_lose> "Cody knife is better than pipe" Kappa
[2:48:11] <yunggrasshopper77> From sf2
[2:48:24] <Edo_Estrella> did she say " Perdon" ?
[2:48:26] <Tippy_OD> The Knife VT for Cody is much more fun tbh
[2:48:36] <Flyawave> Cody's pipe Kreygasm
[2:48:39] <yunggrasshopper77> The game would have been incomplete without Honda
[2:48:40] <Dr_Swaggenheimer> VT1 turns everything into an EX move. It’s better by far.
[2:48:46] <kingdomkid7> what's your real rank in this game vesper ? are u a master player ?
[2:49:06] <megatonbeef> Honda will get vesper to master
[2:49:07] <Deimos002> It's kinda true
[2:49:14] <JamesEdSmith> Vesper is a real Super Silver
[2:49:14] <the_mega_guy_> why you gotta do woshige like that vesperSad
[2:49:20] <NaoeShigen> Poison's CA is just a copy of Whip's SDM from KOF as well.
[2:49:29] <I_nod_my_head_when_I_lose> Original idea, donut steel
[2:49:32] <NightmareJames> Lucia is essentially a modified King from KoF
[2:49:37] <Flyawave> SDM = superdupermove
[2:49:45] <Dr_Swaggenheimer> K’ and Lucia share some characteristics as well @vesperarcade
[2:49:49] <Tippy_OD> King? You mean K' ?
[2:49:50] <Chicken_Curry_Rice> @VesperArcade why does capcom hate rekkas?
[2:49:51] <GladiatorVS> I like How Hond can anti-fireball with his Vskill.
[2:49:51] <NightmareJames> And Poison is Vice
[2:50:01] <GladiatorVS> Pretty awesome.
[2:50:01] <Flyawave> Lucia plays nothing like king. more K' if anything
[2:50:16] <Sandman444a> pog
[2:50:21] <ArmaIy> poor poison zaferiCrine
[2:50:25] <kingdomkid7> vesper plays like a master player steam rolling through everybody with a brand new character it's crazy
[2:50:27] <Dr_Swaggenheimer> Her dp is nowhere near as far reaching though
[2:50:44] <yunggrasshopper77> I like the move when she holds up the whip and shakes her booty.
[2:50:55] <megatonbeef> @kingdomkid7 His character may change but his opponents stay the same
[2:50:55] <Dr_Swaggenheimer> Schiacchi is someone that steamrolls with newer characters
[2:51:13] <Flyawave> why is poison theme so generic?
[2:51:17] <GladiatorVS> Poison and Rashid looks like a match up from hell right now. smh
[2:51:20] <Raikizahi> do u have a change of opinion about Lucia? I mean, ur 1st impression she still suck?
[2:51:21] <kingdomkid7> what do you mean ?
[2:51:22] <I_nod_my_head_when_I_lose> Is this character easier to rank than kage I assume?
[2:51:24] <MaximumEffor7> Setups
[2:51:29] <megatonbeef> Sounds like 80s porn music to me
[2:51:35] <Flyawave> exactly
[2:51:39] <Dr_Swaggenheimer> If you listen closely to Poisons theme you can hear the sfv arcade theme innit.
[2:51:44] <MaximumEffor7> @megatonbeef because it should sound exactly like that
[2:51:54] <knxwledge88> lol
[2:51:57] <megatonbeef> @maximumeffor7 KappaPride

[2:54:46] <the_real_harmicide> Can you do ex DP instead of the ex fireball at the end of that combo?

[2:55:05] <NightmareJames> Well, Honda looks like he puts Karin in her place
[2:55:41] <kingdomkid7> I don't think anyone outdoes karin her techniques are perfect
[2:55:50] <romfinite> she needs a fierce crush counter i think
[2:56:09] <Liddough> Is Honda good
[2:56:26] <wilsonwrecks> I felt like her normal were better than most the cast.
[2:57:02] <yunggrasshopper77> What is her cc? I haven’t seen it yet!
[2:57:12] <Gimme_Makoto> @yunggrasshopper77 sHK
[2:57:27] <fuzzyrpg> Honda is the new cammy, lot of damage and straight foward
[2:57:41] <Efonzerellie> I'm not convinced of Honda yet
[2:57:55] <enjio> hell yeh brother merica
[2:58:01] <Beatles3490> Whats up Vesper and chat
[2:58:20] <yunggrasshopper77> @efonzerellie they say Honda destroys Bison
[2:58:21] <horseapples> anyone who plays lucia is a cop
[2:58:35] <bounty_skull> cesper
[2:58:39] <snowfarmer81> Yeah he's good against bison and balrog
[2:58:39] <I_nod_my_head_when_I_lose> Vesper should of named this account not bad

[2:58:48] <solgen10> id hate to see a bunch of Hondas in any tournament final...
[2:58:48] <bounty_skull> hes not a cop
[2:59:08] <yunggrasshopper77> @snowfarmer81 really?! I was just trolling
[2:59:31] <Efonzerellie> I couldn't see it being worse than facing Laura,Mika,Necalli
[2:59:37] <kingdomkid7> how come you don't compete at any majors vesper ? You obviously have real talent like a pro to compete professionally
[2:59:38] <snowfarmer81> You can blow right true bison normals on reation with ex headbut
[3:00:01] <Hazardpay562> is that 3 female characters that say "right there" now? Laura, Lucia, and Poison...

[3:02:13] <Psyps> i was reminded Cody is actually in the game when they played the trailers during evo
[3:02:20] <kingdomkid7> have you seen warlord grifffon masks blanka ? turbo blanka
[3:02:26] <shevchenko66> No, in Diamond begins the chalenge
[3:02:28] <JackichigoTG> Her combos looks super cool
[3:02:30] <SuperRetroVania> came to see how you play her

[3:04:14] <lock__m> @vesperarcade has your initial opinion of lucia changed since announcment trailer?
[3:04:40] <yunggrasshopper77> Right he spanked you now you blacklist him?
[3:04:58] <TKimura> poison is snooze
[3:05:04] <TKimura> lucia is lit
[3:05:07] <wilsonwrecks> I'm on a 15/1Mb connection, with 3 kids and a wife all streaming on different devices. I'm lucky if I'm playing in warm molasses.
[3:05:25] <enzo152> @ustinodj lul
[3:05:27] <lock__m> thats cool to hear, havent checked your stream since chars came out

[3:06:02] <enzo152> still getting used to her @ustinodj
[3:06:03] <wilsonwrecks> Cheaper to keep her.
[3:06:09] <shevchenko66> What other character you want to see now, Vesper?
[3:06:10] <dyslex666> @wilsonwrecks Prioritize your PS4 or whatever. Your router should be able to do that
[3:06:15] <KudjaIsLoved> So is VT2 for sure the better one?
[3:06:21] <wilsonwrecks> I love her. Just not the connection.
[3:06:25] <Gimme_Makoto> @KudjaIsLoved No. Both are good
[3:06:49] <enjio> her light fireball can be hit again with tatsu
[3:06:52] <Abstrakt_Logic> They need to just put Karin back the way she is supposed to be. She is the Rekka character with the most options ever.
[3:06:58] <lock__m> functions LUL
[3:07:14] <wilsonwrecks> @dyslex666 It's a terrible dsl router they have locked down and I don't have access to. I should buy a new router and set that up.
[3:07:25] <Flyawave> yes
[3:07:30] <Flyawave> you really should
[3:07:37] <solgen10> they just need to put makoto back in and let haitani get the crowd hype again.
[3:07:47] <Gimme_Makoto> @solgen10 :O
[3:08:00] <Abstrakt_Logic> Yes! Makoto, PLEASE!

[3:08:11] <SuperRetroVania> superr15Eh1 superr15Eh1 superr15Eh1
[3:08:13] <horseapples> they shoulda had makoto in the base roster, capcom with the clownery having us wait this long
[3:08:13] <sicayou> wtf he's already plat on lucia?!
[3:08:23] <wilsonwrecks> @VesperArcade great name for your Lucia account by the way!
[3:08:24] <bounty_skull> Mokoto, FEI LONG, and dudley
[3:08:25] <kingdomkid7> vesper you should've compete at evo bro
[3:08:29] <horseapples> yet have sf2 characters every season evo19Mindblown
[3:08:42] <dyslex666> Well, he is blacklisting anyone that beats him... so easy plat Keepo
[3:08:54] <sicayou> @VesperArcade have you settled on how lucia should be played?
[3:09:57] <kingdomkid7> she plays like ken ? Or sakura ?
[3:10:08] <KudjaIsLoved> I've been playing only Nash since Season 1, so Lucia being methodical makes me feel right at home.
[3:10:43] <batzux> hi vesper :D,giftme e,honda :D,ok no :C

[3:15:30] <sicayou> i doubt any pro will pick up lucia even if she is good. too weird of a character to pick up this late in the game's life cycle

[3:25:11] <Chicken_Curry_Rice> Kappa
[3:25:17] <tyrtleascended> don't say guile plz
[3:25:29] <ol_haba> @VesperArcade should i end medium punches into command run vskill for the knockdown and meter?
[3:25:37] <ninjavanish> All I want is a netcode fix
[3:25:42] <NaoeShigen> REAL (naked) Urien.
[3:25:55] <JollyPhobic> The characters are definitely well designed, but three new characters without anything else announced is pretty disappointing
[3:26:08] <Vexnya> not worth hoping for a netcode fix, it won't happen, people need to stop expecting it at this point
[3:26:14] <AzureWotan> wouldnt any new mechanic ideas go to sfvi @vesperarcade
[3:26:27] <ninjavanish> @Vexnya yeah I know
[3:26:33] <ol_haba> @AzureWotan this game is being supported until january 2021
[3:26:36] <sicayou> new mechanics seems doubtful for such an old game. just gotta hope sf6 is announced soon
[3:26:58] <L_Nakata> did you see DESKs combo video for Lucia? shit was hyoe af
[3:27:00] <Vexnya> yeah new mechanics are also not likely this close to the games end imo
[3:27:51] <ol_haba> we'll probably get one more mechanic for vbar to help even up characters that aren't helped by the v system as much as others
[3:27:55] <ninjavanish> @Vexnya they may add something weird like omega mode in SFIV to test stuff out for the next SF
[3:27:56] <Chicken_Curry_Rice> i expect a new vskill for evryone
[3:28:32] <brazil_is_in_da_house> I hope sf6 will worse than this SUPER EASY sfv KID EDITION, i fell capcom is having no ideia for creating something better than this sfv

[3:31:04] <I_nod_my_head_when_I_lose> divekick would just be a v trigger Kappa
[3:31:06] <brazil_is_in_da_house> Do not matter if capcom put a second vtriguer n special , she need change the mechanis, this sfv are slow, easy combos, only smash bottoms n 50/50,
[3:31:16] <dyslex666> @AzureWotan I might hit him on the Up trajectory, but it's too fast.

[3:35:09] <SinisterDetox> he would be considered a rekka character

[3:37:09] <Llesor> yes vesper please
[3:37:10] <SinisterDetox> VOICE CHAAATTT
[3:37:11] <the_mega_guy_> YES
[3:37:14] <I_nod_my_head_when_I_lose> MK11 has voice chat
[3:37:14] <Vitamin_D83> Its inevitable, like Thanos lol
[3:37:17] <SinisterDetox> So we can listen to young thug
[3:37:20] <SinisterDetox> on the other end
[3:37:29] <SinisterDetox> and people noming on chips with babies crying
[3:37:45] <JBMDoolio> depends on what their goal and direction is. I am curious about it, I must admit.
[3:37:55] <shredmaster96> neonpPOG
[3:38:14] <AzureWotan> @vesperarcade maybe then we can get the corki guide finally vesperHollywood
[3:38:17] <JBMDoolio> I have played LoL for like 20 minutes, but I wouldn't mind a rushdown ahri (is that her name?)
[3:38:26] <SinisterDetox> They should have kept arin's theme from SF:A3
[3:38:28] <I_nod_my_head_when_I_lose> I'd play gareth and just spin the whole time Kappa
[3:38:30] <SlimeBeherit> The Lucia voice actress confirmed she's speaking Spanish as Lucia is now Puerto Rican for all those that were wondering
[3:38:40] <NinoDiablo> LoL Fighter would bring in more n00bs
[3:38:52] <estarix> You just got karin'd
[3:38:56] <enzo152> nerf karin emote when Kappa
[3:39:02] <Capiistrado> @Capiistrado is new here. Say hello! HeyGuys
[3:39:21] <horseapples> mississauga strider? LUL
[3:39:37] <enzo152> @Capiistrado vesperCoffee
[3:40:29] <JBMDoolio> but.. ahri summer costume...
[3:40:29] <I_nod_my_head_when_I_lose> it would probably be a weapon based fighter
[3:40:38] <SinisterDetox> @VesperArcade Ms Fortune could easily work in a fighter though!
[3:41:18] <Vexnya> I mean Erron Black works in Mortal Kombat, they can easily make ranged characters in a fighter, not like that is a new concept
[3:41:49] <Ladewaybac> if it was all top lane charactors a lol fighter would work
[3:42:14] <Vexnya> that wouldn't even be necessary
[3:42:24] <I_nod_my_head_when_I_lose> 2v2 team based fighter with supports Kappa
[3:42:35] <JBMDoolio> They could make everyone fit in if they wanted to. Give them some fitting styles and put weapons/spells as special moves and there you go
[3:43:02] <EroSenpai99> a LoL fighting game will die faster than DBFZ even if they make it casual friendly
[3:43:12] <horseapples> a league fighter would prolly have good tourney payout at least. tekken is still having top winners get less than second placers in sf/smash
[3:43:15] <losthighwayblues> Probably gonna be a party fighter like smash bros
[3:43:48] <EroSenpai99> they should make a real shounen jump fighting game and not crap like jump force playstyle
[3:43:48] <Vexnya> if it every actually happens
[3:43:56] <JBMDoolio> everything can be huge with good marketing and big pro incentives
[3:44:01] <sicayou> why lose perfect
[3:44:15] <EroSenpai99> or a shounen jump vs marvel would be sick
[3:44:27] <Vexnya> I mean Riot has more than enough influence and resources to do a lot of marketing and support huge prize pools if they wanted, that won't be an issue
[3:44:50] <RedSPINE> In league of legends, a lot of characters don't use close combat technique at all, being only ranged. I don't think you can make a fighting game without neutral attacks x)
[3:45:17] <JBMDoolio> They can fight with some style that fits their character.
[3:45:21] <AzureWotan> wake up super her
[3:45:33] <estarix> will he do a rassenha?
[3:45:35] <Vexnya> @RedSPINE i mean LoL is a MOBA, it's restricted to roles and shit, fighters are a lot more focused on a lot of moves, you can easily add stuff that characters don't use in the MOBA
[3:45:38] <dyslex666> I'm sure there won't be a walkout about sexual harassment with this new RIOT fighting game. Kappa
[3:45:46] <RedSPINE> I don't think it will look like a party fighter at all. They bought the studio that developped Rising Thunder, so I assume they want something similar.
[3:46:25] <EroSenpai99> Why are you saying is 100% there will be a LoL fighting game?
[3:46:32] <RedSPINE> @Vexnya Yes they could. But from a marketing perspective, if it's good to use known licenses, is it good to do so but break everything from that license ? I don't know
[3:46:37] <Shoryudojo> have you tried Poison yet ?
[3:46:37] <Moobot> Join the Vesper Arcade Discord at https://discord.gg/esjX5km
[3:46:45] <senpai817> lucia v1 or v2
[3:47:12] <AzureWotan> are you still sponsored by that one company @vesperarcade
[3:47:20] <RedSPINE> I don't think they'll use League of Legends characters, or if they do i'll probably be "special" characters, like crossover heroes
[3:47:26] <Vexnya> Like I said, if Erron Black and Kung Jin as mainly ranged character in concept can work in a fighter, it can easily be done with League's ranged characters
[3:47:30] <東凜> lucia seems to have potential to be a top tier character
[3:47:30] <shevchenko66> Vesper, you have piano tips? I can't do Honda combos very well
[3:47:54] <megatonbeef> @shevchenko66 Pad or stick
[3:47:54] <JBMDoolio> Maybe they have some untapped idea and will develop a new popular IP, like Blizzard tried with OW, for example.
[3:48:07] <shevchenko66> @megatonbeef Pad
[3:48:28] <AzureWotan> @vesperarcade stemexpress, the logo isnt on screen anymore
[3:48:32] <EroSenpai99> For Riot and league universe is better to do a Diablo style of game, not a fighting game
[3:48:36] <AzureWotan> memexpress*
[3:48:50] <Liddough> Lucia turned out a lot better than I thought she would. Love that fireball kick
[3:48:53] <RedSPINE> Erron Black and Kung Jin both only existed in Fighting games already, it's different if I take Swain or Aurelion Sol and make them punch and kick x)
[3:49:01] <shevchenko66> i'm trying to do with square and triangle
[3:49:01] <megatonbeef> @shevchenko66 If you can press two at one like light when you hit a heavy or medium punch it adds that punch or use it light punch during any kick
[3:49:32] <EroSenpai99> You can literally make a fighting game out of everything but that doesnt mean is a good idea
[3:49:40] <sicayou> bully
[3:49:50] <RagingMarmot> LUL
[3:49:58] <megatonbeef> @shevchenko66 Press square+r1 triangle +r1 triangle
[3:50:03] <Vexnya> @RedSPINE so you give their neutrals a magic flare, like swipes with magic claws and shit, no one would realistically think that neither of those characters ever use any form of martial ability outside the 4 spells they know in a MOBA
[3:50:09] <bobbyjoe001> Yoink
[3:50:25] <Liddough> We need another celebrity death match
[3:50:44] <ustinodj> @enzo152 not training stage vesperKilley
[3:50:58] <RedSPINE> I don't know. If it seems possible, I don't think it's a good idea, and I don't think Riot considers it's a good idea either.
[3:50:59] <shevchenko66> @megatonbeef Ohh... i understand now!! I go check righ now. Thanks, bro!!
[3:51:06] <dcidaone> Lucia walk speed is insane
[3:51:16] <Shoryudojo> what do you like about Lucia so far ?
[3:51:20] <arcadeperfectreviews> Skullgirls was pretty successful without a big IP
[3:51:22] <Liddough> The people behind LOL are making a fighting game?
[3:51:30] <Azrael_GT> we need more boobs and butts in fighting games, no more pc bullshit
[3:51:34] <Vexnya> @RedSPINE that was not the point, the point is that saying it isn't a thing they can do like it just doesn't work is just wrong, other fighters have shown that
[3:51:44] <xcarbn> @Shoryudojo thighs Kappa
[3:51:47] <megatonbeef> @azrael_gt Dead or alive
[3:51:56] <dcidaone> Lucia walk speed is really good
[3:52:01] <Tristar49> How is Lucias walkspeed compared to Sakura or Akuma?
[3:52:02] <Shoryudojo> lol wow
[3:52:05] <nakadashidee> @RedSPINE it's naysaying at this point, just wait and watch what they come up with
[3:52:06] <RedSPINE> Oh well I didn't say that
[3:52:08] <Azrael_GT> @megatonbeef i want mooooooore games!
[3:52:08] <SlimeBeherit> @xcarbn it's why he was a Honda main
[3:52:10] <Vexnya> regardless of a good idea, it isn't a concept that just doesn't work
[3:52:13] <Liddough> Is that good or bad?
[3:52:13] <EroSenpai99> Strong IPs cant guarateed a good game, look at marvel
[3:52:18] <RedSPINE> I said it would probably look wrong if they do
[3:52:21] <Liddough> Do they have fighting game experience?
[3:52:22] <Azrael_GT> and DOA gameplay sucks
[3:52:27] <megatonbeef> Strip fighter exists
[3:52:46] <Azrael_GT> SFV quality
[3:52:50] <RedSPINE> @Liddough The guys working for Riot rn are the ones that developped Rising Thunder
[3:53:11] <Liddough> If MVC4 gets announced, im going to get a boner so fast, the air pressure in my house is going to change for a moment.
[3:53:18] <Vexnya> I mean lets put it this way, Marvel failed because the game is shit and yet it still has a fan base large enough to have had a presence at tournaments for a long time
[3:53:39] <Vexnya> a strong IP is a boon
[3:53:47] <Liddough> @RedSPINE Was rising thunder good? Ive never heard of it until now.
[3:53:54] <horseapples> i wouldn't say it had a tournament presence for a long time... the game was dead in the water after a few months
[3:53:59] <shevchenko66> @megatonbeef much more easy now, bro... time to training combos. Thanks!!
[3:54:08] <Vexnya> even new IP games that end up being very well made still fail because of that lack of a fan base alone
[3:54:22] <AlmiranteCami> ass shot
[3:54:37] <arcadeperfectreviews> @vexnya nah Skullgirls sold over a million
[3:54:40] <AzureWotan> @vesperarcade throw tech on the return of the shuriken
[3:54:45] <RedSPINE> @Liddough They bought the studio before RT got the chance to be finished, so they release the project source on internet, you can try it for free and I think the goal was to make it F2P anyway
[3:54:54] <megatonbeef> @shevchenko66 Glad I could help it will take time to learn a set sequence for each version so take your time
[3:55:02] <Vexnya> @arcadeperfectreviews and yet the game had a miniscule player base overall, it sold well but died off
[3:55:24] <Vexnya> which is a damn shame, Skullgirls was great, but it was hardly a rousing success
[3:55:48] <enzo152> whats the pw again 1212? @ustinodj
[3:55:54] <Liddough> Hey, look at what marvel has planned. They are expanding big time. They're doing xmen, fantastic 4, avengers video game, why not mvc4 or a fighting game. They might be able to tell the fgc has potential
[3:55:56] <ustinodj> @enzo152 yeah
[3:56:07] <oEntregadorDeGas> is there any lucia bnb vid or text?
[3:56:16] <arcadeperfectreviews> @vexnya selling over a million copies is a huge success for any indie game and people still playing on side tornys at Evo and the like
[3:56:27] <Lord_erixox> the league fighting game is happening or it is just a random thought?
[3:56:50] <Vexnya> @arcadeperfectreviews you don't seem to understand what the word success means in this context
[3:56:53] <RedSPINE> @Lord_erixox We know Riot is developping a FG, but no one knows if it'll be a "League" FG outside of Riot
[3:56:56] <NinoDiablo> Yeah, but will LoL players play a fighting game?
[3:56:58] <megatonbeef> @lord_erixox It’s happening
[3:57:08] <Alfredopotato8784> how are you supposed to block the fireball into low?
[3:57:09] <Liddough> @RedSPINE Looks not bad I guess. It would be so nice to play a great fighter, that brings out new fighters often.
[3:57:14] <Lord_erixox> thx guys
[3:57:20] <arcadeperfectreviews> @vexnya I don't think I do. explain it to me
[3:57:23] <sicayou> lucia is pretty damn scary
[3:57:26] <Vexnya> a lot of fighting games that have faltered still hold the same things and those game are hardly considered a huge success
[3:58:04] <Liddough> Easier than DBZ...ehh
[3:58:09] <Vexnya> there is a reason games that at their core are better games falter compared to worse games with popular IPs
[3:58:24] <ZyxWhitewind> Isn't that Dyrus guy playing like tekken or something now?
[3:58:29] <RedSPINE> Speaking of good looking, I can't wait for more visuals from the next Guilty Gear
[3:58:33] <arcadeperfectreviews> @vexnya so what's a successful to you? what's the standard?
[3:58:54] <SinisterDetox> fire ball is +3 so if the slide lands before the fire ball u make the slide safe
[3:58:59] <NinoDiablo> True, there is cross content between OW and HotS
[3:59:01] <RedSPINE> Success is money, for a company it's all that matters imho
[3:59:07] <SinisterDetox> slide at close range is -4
[3:59:12] <SinisterDetox> but at max range -1
[3:59:17] <megatonbeef> @redspine Candy crush money
[3:59:25] <arcadeperfectreviews> @redspine that's what I'm saying
[3:59:25] <sicayou> i believe you Kappa
[3:59:29] <Vexnya> @arcadeperfectreviews active online player base that maintains enough of a population for casual players to actually be able to enjoy the game outside watching small tournaments
[3:59:32] <RedSPINE> Well Candy Crush is a huge success
[4:00:08] <Lord_erixox> candy crush FG? HYPE
[4:00:09] <shredmaster96> they are like bots honestly Kappa Kappa
[4:00:20] <RedSPINE> Candy crush counter
[4:00:39] <BiscuitTricks> i'm so glad the pardõn has been explained
[4:00:46] <arcadeperfectreviews> @vexnya I see what you mean, but as a business owner I kinda feel like a successful game is one that makes you money
[4:00:55] <megatonbeef> It would be a successful fighting game
[4:00:59] <Vexnya> @arcadeperfectreviews .....
[4:01:21] <Vexnya> @arcadeperfectreviews the context is the game being successful in the eyes of the players not that fucking companies
[4:01:52] <shredmaster96> @vesperarcade i really enjoy your gameplay man ironmeWow ironmeWow ironmeWow ironmeWow ironmeOw ironmeOw
[4:01:56] <RedSPINE> Successful means you completed your objectives. A successful game for a company is one that brings money. A successful game for the players is the one that fits their expectations.
[4:02:07] <RedSPINE> Goals * not objectives sry
[4:02:21] <arcadeperfectreviews> @vexnya I understand, but I don't agree. as a player I still play SG all the time, and I still have friends who play and I still play online. so i don't really agree
[4:02:41] <RedSPINE> What's SG ?
[4:02:53] <arcadeperfectreviews> @redspine Skullgirls
[4:02:57] <megatonbeef> @arcadeperfectreviews So smash is the measure of success every one with the console got it and casuals love it
[4:02:59] <Vexnya> @RedSPINE precisely and while Marvel for example sold more than enough to be considered a success by the company and yet many players believe the game was a shity failure
[4:03:00] <torasamu> Vt1 is better? @vw
[4:03:11] <torasamu> @vesperarcade
[4:03:13] <shredmaster96> wonder951ove wonder951ove wonder951ove wonder951ove wonder951ove wonder951ove
[4:03:19] <megatonbeef> vesperChair vesperChair vesperChair vesperChair vesperChair
[4:03:41] <arcadeperfectreviews> @megatonbeef I would say it's a successful game because it sells 10million copies too lol
[4:03:50] <shevchenko66> Vesper is cold, bro... just looking in the eye of the oponnent
[4:03:52] <RedSPINE> Well, it's your goals. Don't assume I have the same goals as you as a player too hahaha
[4:04:05] <RedSPINE> I consider Marvel to be successful if you tell me it sold well enough copies
[4:04:24] <SinisterDetox> V1 is more damage to her special moves but V2 will cover your ass
[4:04:29] <gtliving> What don’t you like about her??
[4:04:32] <SinisterDetox> you can cancel all normals into V2
[4:04:37] <RedSPINE> Usually, money for the company means they have ways to create hype, updates, tournaments etc. Money is the life energy of a company
[4:04:46] <torasamu> Thanks
[4:04:47] <arcadeperfectreviews> @redspine I agree
[4:05:09] <Shoryudojo> what are Lucia strengths and weaknesses ? so far.
[4:05:16] <Vexnya> and yet many felt the company didn't use that money to make Marvel any better and so it died..
[4:05:40] <Shoryudojo> she seem pretty fun and cool
[4:05:41] <RedSPINE> Are you really sure they had enough money ?
[4:05:54] <shredmaster96> what kind of range is her man?
[4:05:58] <Vexnya> if they were successful then yes
[4:06:05] <Shoryudojo> got it
[4:06:11] <Vexnya> if you don't have the money to make the game betetr I hardly consider it a success
[4:06:14] <Shoryudojo> thanks attachLOVE
[4:06:50] <Vexnya> and if you did have the money and deiced to not listen to players and make the game better and let it die well that is something else entirely
[4:07:05] <RedSPINE> You're the one that said Marvel was successful in the first place bro
[4:07:11] <Vexnya> no i didn't
[4:07:13] <mike_the_greatest> Which anti air is so good on her
[4:07:14] <Vexnya> i never did
[4:07:21] <mike_the_greatest> have you tried st.lk yet?
[4:07:33] <RedSPINE> "Vexnya: @RedSPINE precisely and while Marvel for example sold more than enough to be considered a success by the company and yet many players believe the game was a shity failure"
[4:07:37] <casual_hero_> im pissed if these 3 character were the "announcement"
[4:07:55] <RedSPINE> I actually have no idea about Marvel being or not a success from a money pov
[4:07:56] <arcadeperfectreviews> @vexnya what would you consider the MOST successful game then (genuinely curious)
[4:07:59] <AzureWotan> this Honda is so bunga
[4:08:08] <SinisterDetox> I love lucia
[4:08:09] <Llesor> lot of tools
[4:08:14] <Llesor> and has depth
[4:08:21] <AzureWotan> I think shes B+ tier
[4:08:26] <shredmaster96> Lucía OTP wonder951ove wonder951ove
[4:08:26] <ustinodj> I gotta go, GGs guys
[4:08:26] <Shoryudojo> high mid potential
[4:08:29] <Vexnya> @RedSPINE it that sentence I never said it was a success, but some might be able to consider it such because they simply "made a profit"
[4:08:30] <Shoryudojo> ^^
[4:08:32] <Llesor> night ustin
[4:08:33] <JBMDoolio> I like her. Her CA cancels seem weird though. I think she's solid tier, but not highest.
[4:08:33] <megatonbeef> Your still robbing people from lack of knowledge thoughb
[4:08:35] <the_mega_guy_> see ya ustin
[4:08:43] <Shoryudojo> B Tier for sure
[4:08:44] <Efonzerellie> we'll see a couple pro's pick her up I think
[4:08:46] <Highlyevolv3d> She’s looks the most fun out of the three new characters
[4:08:53] <Alfredopotato8784> wasn't super excited but now I really want to try her
[4:08:57] <Vexnya> @RedSPINE i literally nowhere in that statment said "I think the game is a success" or said " it is a success"
[4:08:59] <Kuroen> I feel she lacks damage to be high tier
[4:09:08] <Kuroen> but she is solid
[4:09:10] <AzureWotan> I feel like infil will pick her up and do some stuff @vesperarcade
[4:09:11] <shevchenko66> this Honda... Jesus!
[4:09:11] <shredmaster96> @highlyevolv3d lol true
[4:09:24] <shredmaster96> cheris7Mochi
[4:09:47] <RedSPINE> "Marvel for example sold more than enough to be considered a success by the company" You said the company had enough money for it to be considered a commercial success
[4:09:47] <estarix> lucia is like a better version of ed/ken.
[4:09:52] <Beatles3490> Does Honda have a 3frame?
[4:10:15] <shredmaster96> @estarix no hadoken tho irinasCRY
[4:10:27] <bossuche9> is poison bad????
[4:10:27] <NaoeShigen> "I don't understand, I chose E. Honda, why am I losing??!!"
[4:10:28] <estarix> her fireball is better than that trash ken has.
[4:10:28] <RedSPINE> I legit don't know, but to say they didn't use their money to update the game and make it better, you need to first prove they had the money to do so
[4:10:29] <SinisterDetox> @VesperArcade I am a rush down kind of player so I love lucia she fits my play style very will in your face so I am glad shes in the game she made SFV for me to be honest since Sakura is not SF4 Sakura
[4:10:32] <Chicken_Curry_Rice> he does not
[4:10:36] <Vexnya> @RedSPINE and this whole time I have stated that i don't consider commercial success to automatically mean a game is considered a success overall, pretty sure I made that clear
[4:10:41] <EroSenpai99> Ex headbutt is so annoying
[4:10:41] <Shoryudojo> no he doesn't @beatles3490
[4:10:48] <gtangjr> @vesperarcade I played Honda when I got back today. He was fine, but boring at my level. My least favorite of the three. I’d rather play Blanka. Poison made the most sense to me initially. I like both her and Lucia quite a bit.
[4:11:07] <striderzer0> is she like k-dash and sakura?
[4:11:11] <estarix> sakura can be played rushdown too
[4:11:14] <gtangjr> Honda’s LK is 4F. Fastest button.
[4:11:15] <Beatles3490> LOL, I would think not either but just checking
[4:11:21] <Alfredopotato8784> listening to "not bad!" every 5 seconds is annoying though haha
[4:11:36] <SinisterDetox> yeah I main sakura but now that Lucia is out im dropping her maybbbbeee
[4:11:41] <SinisterDetox> sakura has better match ups
[4:11:55] <LordHisoka_> ALEXNATION
[4:12:09] <megatonbeef> vesperSpit
[4:12:12] <estarix> lucia's fireball can zone out poison.
[4:12:23] <NaoeShigen> @Alfredopotato8784 It's...not bad.
[4:12:31] <JBMDoolio> I feel like she lacks some mid range buttons. There seems to be nothing "between" c.mk and s.hk, both speed-wise and range-wise. I wish she had something like ibuki/cammy s.hk, a command normal maybe
[4:12:48] <gtangjr> Found out pretty quickly today that Poison’s whip is whiff punishable.
[4:12:57] <shredmaster96> this honda is tanky af
[4:13:02] <SinisterDetox> i like lucias C.mk cause u can cancel run into HK
[4:13:14] <estarix> poison's normals have terrible with the exception of cr hp.
[4:14:11] <SinisterDetox> THAT BOUNCE THOUGH
[4:14:14] <Beatles3490> damn thats sick
[4:14:15] <SinisterDetox> MARIO bOUNCE
[4:14:19] <shredmaster96> gg
[4:14:24] <JBMDoolio> I give 20 bucks to capcom if they give Ibuki's f+hk to lucia
[4:14:30] <ikigai_2> Fuck I got hit
[4:14:33] <bobdobbz> Thicc bounce
[4:14:37] <EroSenpai99> I hope alex valle plays Honda on his strem, i have no idea how to play with or against the him
[4:14:45] <gtangjr> What AA are people using for Poison? All seem to suck.
[4:14:56] <gtangjr> Maybe I missed something.
[4:15:17] <estarix> quarter circle forward lk, cr mp
[4:15:31] <estarix> her anti airs are great
[4:16:02] <gtangjr> The QCF.LK was slow. CR.MP worked best for me. I wouldn’t call either great.
[4:16:17] <JBMDoolio> yeah, from what I saw, her anti airs are good. I can't play her though, she has that dhalsim thing going on, it's like a different game.
[4:16:20] <gtangjr> (Could just be my skill level though)
[4:16:30] <snowfarmer81> He can but its hard
[4:16:35] <estarix> 8 frames startup, and upper body invincible that's standard spead not slow, and it covers cross ups.
[4:17:03] <Shoryudojo> I don't see you using S.HK in the nuetral.
[4:17:03] <striderzer0> i think automattock said he could auto correct on EX heatbutt
[4:17:04] <yunggrasshopper77> @vesperarcade why they keep trying to jump when I have Akuma? They never heard of the back HP?
[4:17:15] <neoshadow15> Still wished capcom released a balanced patch.
[4:17:20] <Bashio_Style> lucia has no damage
[4:17:34] <megatonbeef> @yunggrasshopper77 One good jump in and your down 75% that’s why
[4:17:41] <estarix> she got hit confirmable normals too
[4:17:44] <mgbrams> EX DP doesnt do that much damage
[4:17:51] <senpai817> balance patch is after capcom cup probably
[4:17:59] <Bunky0696> @vesperarcade Does her dp leave you open to crush counter like all other uppercuts?
[4:18:05] <yunggrasshopper77> @megatonbeef lol well they ain’t getting it
[4:18:16] <estarix> vesper is gonna struggle so much with poison
[4:18:19] <indominusrex1345> Capcom can make all the brain dead rushdown characters they want but could they please add anti airs that hit behind the head.
[4:18:26] <Shoryudojo> cr.mp, upper whip, and ex upper whip
[4:18:35] <estarix> the first two frames are bad
[4:18:45] <neoshadow15> I hope it’s after capcom cup @senpai817
[4:18:53] <Beats_By_Noel_Brown> canada costume
[4:19:18] <Tristar49> Shes Canadian?
[4:19:19] <shredmaster96> irinasThinking irinasThinking irinasThinking
[4:19:30] <megatonbeef> No
[4:19:30] <estarix> honda is free
[4:19:40] <Beats_By_Noel_Brown> oh wait thats cleavage not the tip of the leaf
[4:19:47] <Zatak29> america
[4:19:48] <gtangjr> Upper whip was massively slow unless negative edge, but decent on long jump-ins.
[4:20:11] <Zatak29> Canada sorry just saw the leaf
[4:20:13] <estarix> yh the whip anti air is slow, but if your canceling from it's good
[4:20:24] <senpai817> does she say perdon when throwing someone?
[4:20:29] <EroSenpai99> Maybe in November they announce the new mechanics and the patch is released on december... maybe
[4:20:32] <Daveski_215> yes
[4:20:35] <b1gam3r> @vesperarcade i thought it would take too long to get to diamond and it looks like your just breezing through it also hope your having fun playing Lucia
[4:20:45] <Carlosman668> yo, i have a replay for you to watch, use the tag poisonwhip, and watch how i punish poison's whip
[4:20:55] <ninjavanish> playing around with poisons crMP and it beats all cammy's dives kicks clean
[4:21:01] <gtangjr> It’s weird, I still had most fun with Poison, even though I think she’s potentially the weakest of the new characters. Still a long way to go though.
[4:21:02] <Beats_By_Noel_Brown> not bad not bad not bad not bad not bad
[4:21:23] <Carlosman668> im gonna get the chars tomorrow
[4:21:43] <chelgoth> she seems super fun
[4:21:49] <gtangjr> @ninjavanish @estarix I should really lab cr.mp more. I’m glad I asked.
[4:21:55] <yunggrasshopper77> @megatonbeef good one lol
[4:22:08] <Carlosman668> hopefully the replay will be useful for the poison matchup
[4:22:10] <xcarbn> anyone in chat knows does poison have a 3 frame button?
[4:22:25] <Tristar49> Shes American, thats not a maple leaf LUL
[4:22:25] <Carlosman668> no
[4:22:38] <SouljaSleet> lmaooo
[4:22:39] <mgbrams> the big screen in the arena covers the rank of honda at the end of the round ? @vesperarcade
[4:22:58] <snowfarmer81> standing lp
[4:23:03] <snowfarmer81> is 3 frames
[4:23:05] <Carlosman668> fr?
[4:23:15] <yunggrasshopper77> @xcarbn her jab is 3 frames
[4:23:24] <I_nod_my_head_when_I_lose> ranking seems a lot smoother than kage
[4:23:27] <yunggrasshopper77> Yes it is
[4:24:22] <Carlosman668> @vesperarcade for poison whip punish use the tag poisonwhip for the replay if anyone is interested
[4:24:26] <Daveski_215> LUL
[4:24:36] <Bashio_Style> for real lucia does no damage
[4:24:38] <tomfromtheclouds> Good morning @vesperarcade and chat! vesperCoffee vesperCoffee vesperCoffee What's up? FutureMan
[4:24:43] <redpotato> 13 wins gone
[4:24:54] <NewAgeRetroFly> no damage? didn't they say that about rashid too LUL
[4:24:57] <Carlosman668> you can use tags for replays
[4:25:01] <Shoryudojo> you should use s.hk more to fish for CC
[4:25:05] <the_mega_guy_> yo tom
[4:25:11] <brazil_is_in_da_house> Suuuuuuuppppppp Kappa LUL OpieOP MingLee EleGiggle
[4:25:15] <shredmaster96> @carlosman668 ty
[4:25:23] <DerpMuch0> Play Juri you will know what mean doing combo with no damage lol
[4:25:39] <CrimzenDagger> upp
[4:25:42] <Bashio_Style> how many hits is that I know that's going to have alot of salcing
[4:25:43] <CrimzenDagger> sup
[4:26:07] <Carlosman668> how do you find the replay code
[4:26:12] <snowfarmer81> splash is minus 4 on cross up
[4:26:12] <Chicken_Curry_Rice> gotta respeck the lore
[4:26:16] <Carlosman668> so i can post it here
[4:26:32] <DerpMuch0> Cant you just jab to interupt Dosukoi?
[4:27:20] <Carlosman668> @vesperarcade you can look up my cfn for the replay carlosman668
[4:27:22] <DerpMuch0> the headbutt, not the smash :o
[4:27:44] <ninjavanish> StMK into QCF HP is a good whiff punish for poison
[4:27:59] <Mr_Minoan> @VesperArcade based off what you have seen, do you think Honda needs nerfs?
[4:28:01] <Bashio_Style> lucia is hella cute tho
[4:28:09] <megatonbeef> It’s f it’s like Alex stomp you can jab it
[4:29:10] <Carlosman668> because poison whip has a hurtbox, imo bison can use hp to punish any of poison's whip moves
[4:29:10] <Broken_Cobretti> lol isnt that dsp's real name LUL
[4:29:19] <Carlosman668> its sad imo
[4:29:26] <aaron87> is this fake dsp or does he have the misfortune of sharing the same name?
[4:29:29] <DerpMuch0> Honda is mad anoying, I don't think he should be so safe or plus on block, this isn't showing any good gameplay, just random bs.
[4:29:34] <megatonbeef> @broken_cobretti Hes pressing buttons food
[4:29:34] <ninjavanish> also poison backdash is really good
[4:29:37] <AzureWotan> @broken_cobretti look at the resub thing on the right
[4:29:55] <ninjavanish> I'm just now really diving into the character

[4:30:10] <aaron87> who the hell uses their government name as their online tag?
[4:30:13] <Carlosman668> so the only safe moves for poison in neutral is her st.mk
[4:30:21] <chelgoth> hey, you're right! that is dsp's actual name
[4:30:24] <clllp> honda zutuki -4 FailFish
[4:30:27] <chelgoth> wonder if it's actually him
[4:30:28] <Heartshay> oh Its Phil again
[4:30:36] <megatonbeef> Should have paid his taxes
[4:30:43] <Carlosman668> DSP isnt platinum
[4:31:00] <megatonbeef> @carlosman668 He’s 4th place at st food
[4:31:00] <aaron87> i think he's low gold
[4:31:02] <Broken_Cobretti> I thought he was in rookie league Kappa
[4:31:21] <chelgoth> fair enough
[4:31:33] <CrimzenDagger> phil burnell what is this DSP
[4:31:34] <I_nod_my_head_when_I_lose> MY INPUTS DIDN'T GO IN DOOD

[4:32:33] <Carlosman668> except ryu, he is still shit
[4:32:45] <canadianborder321> ya lol
[4:33:11] <Carlosman668> Ryu needs cross up tatsu and more damage overall, then I would consider him solid
[4:33:24] <I_nod_my_head_when_I_lose> Vesper's inputs didn't work, nothing he could do Kappa

[4:41:43] <Spiritual_compass> you gotta respect the lul
[4:41:47] <clllp> LUL
[4:41:48] <tomfromtheclouds> Abigail should have highest stun in the game as he's the biggest mofo. Otherwise, he's in a good spot I think

[4:41:49] <jimslimdragon> He bleeds Vesper
[4:42:07] <nycmax> what's the matta? you wanna cuppa cawfee?

[4:42:18] <NaoeShigen> We're thrown off by the maple leaf cleavage shape.
[4:42:18] <ambiguouslybrown> too many hamburgers
[4:42:20] <I_nod_my_head_when_I_lose> looks like a leaf on her boobs if you stare hard enough Kappa
[4:42:20] <Beatles3490> LOL
[4:42:21] <aaron87> i blame public school
[4:42:31] <SlimeBeherit> @VesperArcade also works as her Puerto Rican colors, so it's a two for one
[4:42:32] <CrimzenDagger> im from canada too lmaao so i know lmaao

[4:42:43] <nycmax> what's up Vesper. how you liking Lucia?
[4:42:44] <dark_draw> Hey Vesper what rank did you reach on Apex
[4:42:46] <Vexnya> Nah its not americans because americans just think everything is american, we don't confuse american things for other countries kappa
[4:42:56] <Vexnya> Kappa
[4:42:59] <the_mega_guy_> kinda looks like clown colors
[4:42:59] <Beats_By_Noel_Brown> Remember vesper clowning this character Kappa
[4:43:05] <the_mega_guy_> just missing some yellow
[4:43:10] <nycmax> hell yeah. she's my favorite so far
[4:43:11] <NaoeShigen> CONFIRMED: Lucia gets her cawfee from Tim Horton's...with a side of Timbits.
[4:43:11] <CountMeowingtonn> tfw maximilian shat all over sfv to thousands of people FeelsGoodMan
[4:43:17] <I_nod_my_head_when_I_lose> did anyone reach diamond on apex
[4:43:20] <machriphi> "Big Patch"
[4:43:23] <chelgoth> that outfit and colors reminds me a lot of Tiffany from rival Schools
[4:43:30] <nycmax> from what I heard Lucia is Puerto Rican lol
[4:43:36] <Beats_By_Noel_Brown> Japan voice for Canadian Lucia
[4:43:37] <the_mega_guy_> I remember when vesper told us that it was "bad news" that he was quitting apex LUL
[4:43:40] <Vexnya> maximillian shits over a lot of fighting games to thousands of people
[4:43:57] <dark_draw> To many Altinator disrupter rounds
[4:43:59] <I_nod_my_head_when_I_lose> I miss apex FeelsBadMan
[4:44:01] <bulldogmicrowave> "We are working on something big for ST5!"
[4:44:05] <Beatles3490> @CountMeowingtonn Was that tonight?
[4:44:09] <machriphi> Does Max even play fighting games?
[4:44:11] <CountMeowingtonn> soul calibur 6 will never be shit on, it's a shining light to all fans that we must protect VoHiYo
[4:44:22] <horseapples> is black ops 4 a fighting game? Kappa
[4:44:22] <b1gam3r> @vesperarcade is Lucia's pressure good or is it just ok
[4:44:25] <CrimzenDagger> johnny Fapple Seed the fuck he likes to fapped i guess
[4:44:33] <Vexnya> @machriphi not really
[4:44:34] <CountMeowingtonn> @Beatles3490 yeah, it was like a 30 minute conversation on why sfv is ass lmao
[4:44:36] <horseapples> @CountMeowingtonn heck yeah, gimme setsuka in season 2 baby
[4:44:45] <machriphi> @CountMeowingtonn I haven't played for months but I've been on the past 2 days cause my SC3/4 main Cass is back.
[4:44:47] <Beatles3490> @CountMeowingtonn LOL, I gotta find that
[4:44:49] <LordHisoka_> i always question why ppl never play naked urien, thats why hes losing rn
[4:45:08] <Renpool> U did the combo throw
[4:45:09] <b1gam3r> sorry I pop in and out I try to stay as long as I can
[4:45:09] <bunny_1990> Cheer100 Cheer100 Hey @vesperarcade ... Do you plan on doing a BnB guide for Lucia in the near future? I want to start learning this game with her but don't have starting point with basic combos... Anyway appreciate the content on youtube either way :)
[4:45:25] <Vexnya> meh I have my issues with SCVI
[4:45:34] <clllp> cr.mk hit confirm?
[4:45:34] <NaoeShigen> @LordHisoka_ SRSLY, you aren't playing Urien unless he's wearing the thong. How are you even supposed to channel your inner Urien with all those clothes on?
[4:45:45] <Vexnya> it's not bad by any means, just not amazing
[4:45:47] <machriphi> I don't love SC6, but I love SC, so I'm just glad there's a current game.
[4:45:48] <dark_draw> Apex will have solos on 13th now
[4:45:59] <horseapples> scvi is better than tekken anyway
[4:46:02] <machriphi> @dark_draw No shit? I didn't think they'd ever do that.
[4:46:10] <horseapples> actual proper 3d fighter not some weird jiggle fest into mids lol
[4:46:15] <clllp> Kreygasm
[4:46:18] <LordHisoka_> @NaoeShigen LOOL someone who gets it!
[4:46:18] <I_nod_my_head_when_I_lose> apex solos vesperKilley at least Vesper will be happy
[4:46:20] <toeknee617> mdid her fireball go through uriens??
[4:46:22] <Vexnya> @horseapples heavily disagree frankly
[4:46:23] <nycmax> you prefer V1 or V2?
[4:46:24] <jlocke714> hehe, jiggle fest
[4:46:24] <machriphi> I've always liked SC better than Tekken, but Tekken 7 is better than SC6 unfortunately.
[4:46:33] <Renpool> The graphics in sc6 is better ... clothes actually fit
[4:46:40] <horseapples> tekken 7 is a bore imo
[4:46:45] <machriphi> Who cares about graphics?
[4:46:46] <phil_burnell82> i don't got enough money to buy the dlc characters, all my money goes to my bills
[4:46:50] <CountMeowingtonn> they're fixing that RE thing to make it less of a random rng cutscene in season 2 so that's good for those who had issues with it
[4:46:52] <dark_draw> Yeah man solos on 13th will be intresting
[4:46:55] <machriphi> Oh wait, everyone, that's why MvCI had to die
[4:46:57] <Vexnya> imo T7 is definitely the strongest current fighter out there atm imo
[4:47:01] <jlocke714> yeah, don't care for Tekken 7 either...
[4:47:21] <machriphi> @CountMeowingtonn Oh are they? I got the impression they were buffing it which I found irksome
[4:47:24] <horseapples> idk what people see in t7, seriously just jiggling back and forth and doing jabs for 80% of it
[4:47:47] <nycmax> I like her light fireball because you can throw it straight with Qcb kick
[4:47:55] <Renpool> We have so many fighting games but I just try to play what I can
[4:47:59] <I_nod_my_head_when_I_lose> I used to love tekken growing up from a scrubs perspective
[4:48:01] <Beats_By_Noel_Brown> big plays
[4:48:13] <machriphi> I've always disliked the way Tekken feels. Like the weightiness of the whole thing has always felt off, but I respect the game at a high level. That shit is hard to play.
[4:48:24] <Renpool> Poison and Lucia got me back into sf 5 though
[4:48:38] <phil_burnell82> i wanna play tekken but i don't understand how to do k back dashing
[4:48:40] <horseapples> it's hard to play for dumb reasons though heh, idk if it's good that a game just has stupid movement inputs
[4:48:44] <jlocke714> I came back for Honda
[4:48:53] <Vexnya> @horseapples people like the neutral game, it's about pressure and opening people up, and people sometimes prefer that over just up ins and block strings
[4:48:56] <Beats_By_Noel_Brown> damn he almost had that
[4:49:00] <nycmax> Honda and poison did for me but Lucia caught my attention lol
[4:49:01] <CountMeowingtonn> @machriphi in an interview they said they're gonna rework how it works so that the flow of the match isn't destroyed like it is now
[4:49:03] <SlimeBeherit> @phil_burnell82 SFII is the wrong speed!
[4:49:06] <machriphi> @Renpool Yeah I feel you. I'm still trying to get better at SamSho, then characters I want to try in SFV come out and my old main in SC. I don't have time for all this shit.
[4:49:07] <jlocke714> don't think I dashing is needed for more causal play
[4:49:10] <Fgcdrizzy> @jlocke714 same
[4:49:29] <phil_burnell82> it was the perfect speed in 04
[4:49:42] <Renpool> I think tekken is very character oriented ... I just remember playing Julia and she just came out... I still suck with her just like the old days
[4:49:48] <Vexnya> you don't need to master tekkens movement for casual play, if you want to take it to stupid high ranks than yes, but that is only expected
[4:49:49] <horseapples> @Vexnya idk, jiggling into block strings isn't much different from this scrub's perspective
[4:50:03] <jlocke714> too many damn moves in Tekken
[4:50:12] <jlocke714> like I just get lost in the move lists
[4:50:24] <ProT0Hype> same here jlocke
[4:50:25] <machriphi> We're getting more fighting games next year too. There's too many. We're living in a golden age of fighters and I don't have time for it. I supposed it's a good problem to have.
[4:50:35] <ambiguouslybrown> What do you think about Lucia's VTrigger 2? Seems pretty strong for conversions off standing and crouch jab and it's only 2 bars
[4:50:42] <toeknee617> I don't like her idle animation.. besides that she is cool
[4:50:51] <clllp> honda stage good Jebaited
[4:50:56] <CountMeowingtonn> i like talim in sc6 VoHiYo
[4:51:04] <phil_burnell82> do you find games faster on pc ?
[4:51:06] <machriphi> @CountMeowingtonn Don't ever talk to me again DansGame
[4:51:12] <CountMeowingtonn> Kappa
[4:51:21] <Vexnya> I mean the juggles are basically the same thing as full combos in any other game, not sure how that is a downside in comparison
[4:51:26] <SlimeBeherit> curious what they will do for KoF 15. I assume they will put more into the presentation as it was wildly ignored for its subpar look
[4:51:30] <ambiguouslybrown> yeah, v1 gives you the bouncing fireballs so you dont have to burn meter
[4:51:46] <bulldogmicrowave> t7 you have jiggling in and out. in SF5 you have shimmies.do you tech the throw or get walk backed on into a guess between grab and walk back/jab
[4:51:54] <Renpool> I like groh, 2b and the shield maidens... but make my friends quit when I bring out the axe man
[4:51:57] <phil_burnell82> ii hope kof looks as good as samsho
[4:52:09] <machriphi> @SlimeBeherit Yeah, SamSho looks better so I'm hoping that trend continues. Even if it's not super high graphic fidelity if they just have a better art style it'd go a long way.
[4:52:11] <SlimeBeherit> @phil_burnell82 lol, i cant tell if sarcasm or not
[4:52:24] <jlocke714> it's the juggle into screw move into juggle into death....and I'm like..neat I threw one pumch
[4:52:27] <Fgcdrizzy> @renpool same for my asta
[4:52:34] <machriphi> SamSho looks pretty good. Like it's not about graphics it's about art style.
[4:52:49] <Vexnya> you only get juggled constantly in Tekken if you have no defense and can't punish launchers, no different from getting full comboed in other fighters
[4:52:49] <ambiguouslybrown> Yeah, I guess both are good. V1 maybe better just cause it conserves more meter. V1 is also weird tho cause you cant do any EX moves while it's active
[4:52:52] <machriphi> It looks a lot better than KOF14
[4:52:54] <ambiguouslybrown> which means no EX dp???
[4:53:00] <Renpool> Samsho really is about old school punishes too
[4:53:00] <SlimeBeherit> @machriphi yeah agreed, Technically SasmSho doesn't look too impressive, but the art style does, and that trumps the technical aspect for me
[4:53:39] <Renpool> U can cut people in half when u win in samsho
[4:54:31] <Renpool> I’m glad they got rid of poisons rekkas
[4:54:49] <horseapples> i'm glad they got rid of her fireball, why the hell would poison have one
[4:55:17] <CountMeowingtonn> Poison is fun and slept on rn don't @ me
[4:55:20] <Renpool> I find her more fun to play in 5
[4:55:37] <CountMeowingtonn> yeah you can sleep on a 2 day old character SHUT UP
[4:55:55] <SinisterDetox> street fighter 4 had the best character themes
[4:56:01] <Renpool> Everyone is a cup o coffee main right meow
[4:56:10] <Raynys> Veeeeeeesp, what's up man? How you feel with this new S tier character aka Lucia? LUL
[4:56:12] <CountMeowingtonn> I like all 3 of the new character themes
[4:56:17] <SlimeBeherit> @SinisterDetox the G theme isn't in SFIV so thats not possible
[4:56:26] <SinisterDetox> ew
[4:56:40] <SinisterDetox> lol!
[4:56:44] <aaron87> yeah if only she was s tier. not saying she's bad or anything
[4:56:49] <Renpool> S++
[4:56:51] <Fgcdrizzy> this ryu is doing a solid job of checking your pressure attempts
[4:57:04] <toeknee617> also Lucia theme is nice
[4:57:21] <SlimeBeherit> not to mention the Juri theme Kappa
[4:57:33] <SlimeBeherit> seriously DONT MENTION IT
[4:57:34] <SinisterDetox> dude
[4:57:35] <hilikusss> when is vesper playing tekken again they added the other walking dead character with dreads
[4:57:40] <SinisterDetox> uggggghhhh
[4:57:46] <hilikusss> i know vbesper loves the walking dead
[4:57:46] <SinisterDetox> juris theme made me so mad in this game
[4:57:47] <Kronoch> we don't speak about the sfv juri theme
[4:57:49] <Vexnya> please just don't mention juri, let alone her theme, that character is depressing
[4:57:52] <CountMeowingtonn> when is vesper playing sc6, the superior 3d fighter Kappa
[4:57:53] <SinisterDetox> i was like like WTF IS TIS
[4:57:55] <Raynys> this guy think his slk is plus 10? Jeeeeeeeez he press so many buttons after a -2 LUL
[4:58:03] <SinisterDetox> her sf4 theme was so sick
[4:58:09] <hilikusss> wow that skin is so american
[4:58:12] <Renpool> The juri theme
[4:58:20] <hilikusss> gotta resPECT THE LAW
[4:58:21] <SlimeBeherit> @SinisterDetox her new one is also sick, in a different way
[4:58:23] <CountMeowingtonn> i like progressive house beats :p
