[0:09:54] <Jelestine> Yo what's for dinner tonight boss? I'm thinkin Ramen
[0:10:20] <supers4iy4n_kid> Song name?
[0:10:23] <Jelestine> Nah, im messing around, what's happenin?
[0:10:50] <Jelestine> Ah, that was what my next question was going to be, I was gonna ask about how the poison grind has been going
[0:11:14] <Jelestine> People seem to be enjoying VT2 more than the Molotov due to the command grab
[0:13:08] <Jelestine> Why is that?
[0:13:11] <supers4iy4n_kid> that spacing gotta be perfect
[0:13:15] <Jelestine> Does it make it inconsistent?
[0:17:44] <Jelestine> How goes the getting used to stance cancels during actual matches?

[0:19:35] <strawhatrein> How was NLBC Sonic
[0:20:03] <Jelestine> I think it's because Punk is streaming netplay of Poison, so people are going there to copypaste what he does
[0:20:16] <Taglog7> Music and Fighting <3
[0:20:26] <tigerarar> sol what icecream do you like
[0:20:27] <Nightbot> If my stream randomly disconnects after a few hours of streaming i am not offline, I will come back online in roughly 1 minute. I don't mean to disconnect but I am experiencing packet loss issues.
[0:21:44] <mehding69008> hi everybody , yo Sol
[0:21:58] <tigerarar> hi
[0:22:28] <function_2> rooD "Not bad"
[0:23:14] <mehding69008> i really think her mixed are crazy with the fly kick cross and all other stuff, i really think she can be a nightmare for opponents
[0:23:24] <mehding69008> mix ups
[0:24:00] <tigerarar> lul not bad
[0:25:10] <mehding69008> instead hard break try with lp and mp the the light dp with kick
[0:26:06] <Jelestine> All im hearing is Lucia screaming and saying "Not bad" and it's not entirely bad
[0:26:18] <cairyhooch> @sonic_sol When is it practical to use the whip cancel stuff?
[0:26:24] <mehding69008> the quarter cercle light kick
[0:28:03] <mehding69008> just instead of hard break do hardbreak with lp and mp the follow with qcf lk
[0:29:00] <Jelestine> I can hear you Sol
[0:29:03] <Jelestine> It's good
[0:29:03] <tigerarar> yea
[0:29:06] <Jssippi> nah i hear you
[0:30:06] <mehding69008> there is also the ex avant like who can catch up maybe
[0:30:14] <tigerarar> so dont randomly ex shoder check you
[0:30:44] <mehding69008> or the high one??
[0:30:56] <mobus99> is st hp cancel into st mp better than cr mp into st mp?
[0:31:04] <cairyhooch> ^^
[0:31:13] <cairyhooch> was wondering the same thing
[0:31:38] <mehding69008> ok i see you
[0:32:40] <mehding69008> you re very good for cancelling avant line to mp gg
[0:33:24] <leafSHADOW157> Sup peeps!? jimHey jimHey OWL2019Tracer OWL2019Tracer
[0:33:42] <maddywillz2015> Did you go to EVO?
[0:33:49] <mehding69008> you have to cancel avant line to make mp in you combos right
[0:33:51] <mobus99> Thats a godlike setup cuz they have to walk forward to avoid burn damage
[0:34:02] <leafSHADOW157> Doing good. How's everyone else doing?
[0:34:17] <venombh21> her damage is savage
[0:34:22] <maddywillz2015> I wanted to go but that $2500 I almost spent looked so sexy just sitting in my savings
[0:35:03] <mehding69008> not avant line lol heart raid is cancellable
[0:35:14] <toka222> @maddywillz2015 spoken like a responsible adult
[0:35:26] <maddywillz2015> @toka222 lol
[0:35:39] <maddywillz2015> @toka222 Also, My girl was like, you're about to drop a couple grand to go to vegas just to be around a bunch of sweaty men that play games
[0:35:40] <mehding69008> CANCELLABLE WITH MP
[0:35:44] <tigerarar> so hey guys pls block low when fighting lucia on the ground
[0:35:50] <toka222> @maddywillz2015 loooooooool
[0:36:21] <maddywillz2015> @toka222 Told he to be careful cuz Vegas is the land of Sin, plenty of brothels and shit to get into out there so dont temp me
[0:36:30] <maddywillz2015> *her
[0:36:43] <leafSHADOW157> I love how Lucia keeps saying "NOT BAD!" over and over and over again. LUL LUL
[0:36:46] <OmarLOLgamer> @sonic_sol Hey i just started how do i make my controller settings like soi can press every combo
[0:37:23] <mehding69008> yes but its not sooo easy for every one so i said gg lol, the misunderstanding is because i said avant line lol
[0:38:00] <toka222> practice xenoSch xenoNotes
[0:38:02] <maddywillz2015> Funny thing is @sonic_sol I was binge watching random SFV videos and randomly ran into your stream not knowing you were the guy that washed LTG
[0:38:17] <mobus99> Everything possible on stick is possible on pad, but some things are inheritantly easier or harder to do
[0:38:18] <OmarLOLgamer> the problem is some buttons i cant oress
[0:38:19] <OmarLOLgamer> ?
[0:38:24] <OmarLOLgamer> press*
[0:38:38] <maddywillz2015> He's actually decent
[0:38:43] <maddywillz2015> So you simply outplayed him
[0:38:58] <toka222> do you mean button combinations?@omarlolgamer
[0:39:01] <leafSHADOW157> He is decent true.
[0:39:31] <maddywillz2015> Yea it's his attitude
[0:39:46] <RevrJr> he talks too much for a person that isnt good
[0:39:58] <maddywillz2015> I watched you and some Chun-Li who #@#% him up 50-0
[0:40:02] <mehding69008> i think ps4 controller and arcade stick are both good, the difference is maybe better feeling with stick
[0:40:33] <maddywillz2015> Now I see why they compare him to DSP
[0:40:33] <JaySiabot> Bro i feel you I used to be like that with MK but sometimes you have accept the fact that you get out played and when I get in that mind set I’ve got better
[0:40:45] <toka222> I've actually heard from ppl that ltg is a pretty nice guy irl? rooShrug
[0:40:47] <scratchx_o> who we talking about?
[0:41:09] <tgJamieErin> sad life lolol
[0:41:11] <tgJamieErin> i love it
[0:41:32] <BigKahunaBanana> after the kick into v trigger, if you dash forward you have a safe jump setup
[0:41:41] <mehding69008> i feel baddddd lol
[0:41:41] <maddywillz2015> @toka222 I'm sure he's definitely not the tough guy he portrays online. I saw snippets of him on that wack SFV reality show and he was the most tame
[0:41:47] <toka222> I'd say welp time to hit the training lab again
[0:41:48] <tigerarar> poison make me feel like im playing hazama with the stance cancel
[0:42:12] <toka222> haxama
[0:42:20] <toka222> hazama the snake god
[0:42:32] <maddywillz2015> SFV does impact the psyche of many players
[0:42:34] <JaySiabot> True
[0:42:45] <maddywillz2015> I like your attitude though @sonic_sol
[0:42:47] <tigerarar> dp the shit out of them says ken
[0:42:53] <toka222> jonesaDP
[0:43:00] <GoukiBryant> !netplay
[0:43:01] <scratchx_o> Maybe if people block they wouldn't be so salty about getting hit with setups Kappa
[0:43:06] <BigKahunaBanana> people just gotta realize in fighting games you can't play without an opponent, you gotta appreciate that always
[0:43:06] <maddywillz2015> Most players are absolutely self-absorbed and delusional and cringe to listen to
[0:43:15] <mobus99> Tbh i dont wanna play any fighters with my friends anymore, cuz if I stomp them they quit, even when they were bodying me before
[0:43:21] <maddywillz2015> Most "streamers" I should say
[0:43:27] <PerfectZen> @mobus99 i feel you
[0:43:38] <mehding69008> @maddywillz2015 yes ppl take it tooo seriously, and forget the fun aspect
[0:43:39] <toka222> if you get mixed you get mixed
[0:43:53] <tigerarar> dang fighting game philosophy
[0:44:02] <PerfectZen> I beat my friend day 1 on kof 13 back in 2011 and he never touched the game again
[0:44:13] <PerfectZen> he was so hype : im getting this day one
[0:44:25] <PerfectZen> he wasnt even that bad, he just needed to put some more time in...
[0:44:29] <maddywillz2015> @mehding69008 So true, which is why I miss Excellent Adventures so much. One of the few shows that actually made the game look fun
[0:44:31] <mobus99> Instead of easier combos, we need a higher sportsmanship barrier to entry LUL
[0:44:47] <BigKahunaBanana> poison Kreygasm
[0:44:53] <mobus99> Poison is awesome
[0:44:53] <JaySiabot> A lot of people forget that it’s supposed to be fun
[0:44:59] <toka222> excellent adventures PepeHands
[0:45:05] <scratchx_o> People get too pressed about FGs. Like, if you get mixed then you gotta hold that. If you get outplayed the hold that
[0:45:10] <JaySiabot> But o actually met him at CEO 2018 he’s a cool dude
[0:45:12] <strawhatrein> finally NLBC discussion
[0:45:40] <scratchx_o> Damn
[0:45:41] <mehding69008> i dont knox excellent adventures lol
[0:45:42] <scratchx_o> LUL
[0:46:08] <toka222> I'm just looking at pixelated titties
[0:46:48] <BigKahunaBanana> without meter you can get safe jump setup kimpriNgthuglife
[0:46:56] <maddywillz2015> @mehding69008 It was a weekly FGC show ran by Mike Ross and Gootecks. They would invite various players and even had celebrity guests on there just playing fighting games and having fun
[0:47:11] <toka222> and drink^
[0:47:20] <mobus99> And they can probably EX wakeup out
[0:47:22] <strawhatrein> excellent adventures already ancient history
[0:47:28] <strawhatrein> I feel old
[0:47:30] <toka222> PepeHands
[0:48:02] <mehding69008> i think you now the mix up with ex heart raid with lp and hp then a throw. you are plus he ll have to make a dp or stuff like that or a jump
[0:48:29] <mehding69008> know
[0:48:46] <BigKahunaBanana> do you have dcord? might be easier to just show you then explain
[0:49:11] <BigKahunaBanana> oh fsho
[0:49:14] <TheVillain_x> Poison got setups wiith the bombs
[0:49:50] <Frabisaur> You go to nlbc last night?
[0:50:30] <Frabisaur> Oh boo, shoulda played poison
[0:50:41] <Frabisaur> How’d the casuals go?
[0:50:47] <mehding69008> is it the middle one, the big light or medium?, i just said ex and specified the good buttons lol
[0:51:11] <mobus99> I'd call Sagat a shoto
[0:51:12] <howdoicomputer> yep
[0:51:12] <BigKahunaBanana> I just messaged you it on twitch, it's against gief but you'll get the general idea
[0:51:14] <strawhatrein> shotos? really
[0:51:19] <strawhatrein> interesting
[0:51:23] <KingFossilFER> is it a problem that kolin can counter poison's whip?
[0:51:26] <leafSHADOW157> SAGAT!? More like....... come on guys...
[0:51:37] <Brandonxm> @sonic_sol how's it going
[0:51:54] <mobus99> If its not a problem for Sim it shouldnt be for Poison
[0:52:21] <Nationalgamingvanguard> they do
[0:52:25] <actioncomics1000> hye sonic how you doing today man.
[0:52:30] <Nationalgamingvanguard> coming from a Kolin player
[0:52:54] <Crack______> Vt2 could be useful for baiting vreversals. i think as people learn the MU they'll start to vreversal on second hit of heart raid though so you cant vtrigger cancel and command grab punish it. NotLikeThis
[0:53:03] <maddywillz2015> Yo @sonic_sol you gotta Crypto Wallet?
[0:53:05] <tigerarar> v skill
[0:53:08] <Brandonxm> @sonic_sol have you fought a Urien has Poison if so what do you think of the matchup ?
[0:53:15] <Brandonxm> as*
[0:53:44] <mehding69008> yes normal reaction is a jump cause she can hit low
[0:54:36] <mehding69008> i think she can patrol the air space
[0:55:47] <ultimatum_nova> her down strong is +4 OB???
[0:56:01] <mobus99> It combos into lights
[0:56:19] <mobus99> Oh wait, OB PogChamp
[0:56:50] <mehding69008> you can pressure sooo much wit this char, start with v skill + hk then you plus durant 8 sec
[0:57:27] <mobus99> So Poison is more offense than defense overall?
[0:58:33] <mehding69008> yes but its still good
[0:59:19] <mehding69008> yes shes more offense, defense is bad
[0:59:28] <mehding69008> from my point
[0:59:45] <madhatterbest> This looks like one handed play to me
[1:00:18] <mojoefgc> explain how poison loses to shotos?
[1:00:22] <PoklaSo> how's your poison going?
[1:00:25] <mehding69008> yes on jump and corner
[1:00:35] <mobus99> Honda fucks her up from my experience
[1:00:42] <Kays71088> poison imo seems like a incomplete character. her gameplan is to zone but her range attacks have hurt boxes, she struggles with dealing with fireballs.
[1:00:47] <Nationalgamingvanguard> I just got jumpscared by Akuma
[1:00:48] <lilikoifish> everyone fucks her up
[1:02:01] <mehding69008> me too akuma killed my poison lol
[1:02:13] <madhatterbest> Should roshi be in fighterz?
[1:02:33] <Kays71088> and with her zoning not being great it encourages you to become more rush down oriented. however with her stubby normals its makes it hard to do rush down
[1:02:37] <madhatterbest> Wait why is her eye glowing?
[1:02:49] <lilikoifish> her eye glows in vt2
[1:02:49] <Aeronage> she has juri's eye Kappa
[1:02:59] <eviler86> is there a poison discord?
[1:03:09] <qk10min> look at the VT gauge, you can fly
[1:03:16] <PoklaSo> Ooh love your music!
[1:04:14] <JordantheKitty> that there is a macrowalk
[1:04:19] <mobus99> Is there any reason not to j hk if they block V skill?
[1:04:26] <Crack______> Sorry if you already talked about it but what is the setup after regular command grab?
[1:04:40] <spacedetectivekh> UH OHHHH WHATS GOOD CHAT WE IN THIS B****
[1:05:03] <madhatterbest> Btw janemba has sword stuff on his heavies and one special, you looked pretty bummed cuz you thought it was just the super
[1:05:08] <spacedetectivekh> That man sonic baccc with more thicc poison action
[1:05:34] <mobus99> Poison makes me want to actually lab shit
[1:05:58] <mobus99> I love Gief to death but i feel like theres no tech left
[1:06:47] <mehding69008> i lab her a lot and made all trials im pretty proud
[1:07:19] <mobus99> Dat damage tho, and she gets 3?
[1:07:25] <madhatterbest> That walk up kick looks too fast for a crush counter
[1:07:27] <mobus99> AND a 2 bar
[1:07:31] <Crack______> it definitely adds a layer to her mixup she can put herself in alot of +2 situations.
[1:07:37] <JordantheKitty> her vt1 does even more damage
[1:08:08] <mobus99> That ones a 3 bar and u only get 2, so both are good
[1:08:10] <mehding69008> this v trig can be an help for the defense i think, it ll stop ppl to rush at her.
[1:08:15] <mojoefgc> vt2 is very good
[1:08:16] <JordantheKitty> vt1 is 2 bars silly
[1:08:20] <mobus99> Oh my bad
[1:08:24] <Nightbot> Thanks for watching! If you wanna see continuing content; Youtube - https://www.youtube.com/c/SonicSol |Twitter - https://twitter.com/SonicMonarch | Discord - https://discordapp.com/invite/cuPcGaA
[1:08:34] <mojoefgc> if they wakeup backdash, jump roundhouse catches them
[1:08:40] <tigerarar> i hate cc but they work for the flow of the game
[1:08:43] <mojoefgc> her neutral cmg is similar to laura cmg
[1:08:53] <Nationalgamingvanguard> MU against Menat is fucked up
[1:09:02] <Nationalgamingvanguard> she can just normal your zoning away
[1:09:03] <mobus99> Does Menat have any bad MUs?
[1:09:07] <mojoefgc> also, ex m.raid into neutral cmg does a good amount of damage
[1:09:51] <mehding69008> her CC is godlike
[1:09:52] <mobus99> For as OP as Menat is, there arent that many Menat players, as opposed to the army of Akumas and Guiles
[1:10:27] <mehding69008> zoning army they call hem lol
[1:10:47] <mobus99> And its got R A N G E
[1:11:06] <HelenaGenius> tech a command grab i done a lot
[1:11:29] <Nationalgamingvanguard> you cant do anything to Menat
[1:11:41] <4percentagon_jr> whats the command grab startup?
[1:11:43] <spacedetectivekh> I can dig it
[1:11:43] <HelenaGenius> i jump on it once before
[1:12:41] <mobus99> "Spiral Arrow!!" Kappa
[1:12:49] <JordantheKitty> but on the other hand vt1 has some crazy setups on its own for its own mixups and they're safer than a command grab
[1:13:02] <mehding69008> its anti firebals also
[1:13:08] <mobus99> I like controlling space with VT1
[1:14:28] <WaterKirby1964> Hey Sonic Sol
[1:14:29] <mobus99> So VT1 isnt great for comebacks?
[1:14:39] <mehding69008> it gives you 2 fire balls also (molotov)
[1:15:42] <WaterKirby1964> I'm hoping to get Samurai Shodown, for the PS4, this Sunday
[1:16:29] <mehding69008> yes but it cancel normal balls and its faster to move after than after a fb
[1:16:40] <Fullmetalross> corner routes are better since don't need two molotov, maybe better theory to move them ot the corner with first
[1:17:31] <mehding69008> ex use ressource too
[1:17:37] <WaterKirby1964> From the Samurai Shodown Season 1 Pass, I'm Super Hyped for Kazuki
[1:18:11] <tigerarar> nah give her more ways to fuck over fire balls
[1:19:50] <Aeronage> thats why you have EX Medium heart raid and the EX Flip
[1:19:55] <mobus99> What decides which fireballs Poison can V skill over? Height?
[1:20:01] <mehding69008> yes i understannd but in certainn situation it can help no?
[1:20:07] <Aeronage> really?
[1:20:10] <Aeronage> i didnt
[1:20:19] <WaterKirby1964> Why are so many people playing as Genjuro?
[1:20:28] <WaterKirby1964> Just Curious
[1:21:32] <Vzu_> infil won evo w Genjuro too
[1:21:54] <WaterKirby1964> Can we all agree that Chample from Samurai Shodown, is so adorable?
[1:22:25] <Aeronage> but we can agree that mina is bae Kappa
[1:22:55] <aleromero1> V-skill doesn't work against high fireballs too, likes Sagat's
[1:22:57] <WaterKirby1964> Chample is Mina's Adorable Friend
[1:23:17] <howdoicomputer> is this toshiki kadomatsu tho
[1:23:32] <howdoicomputer> thx
[1:23:45] <dasmesee> Iused to feel guily making him cry when you beat her lol
[1:24:05] <DomBlazee> Basara dlc is too far away :( how’s it going sol
[1:24:19] <WaterKirby1964> Infiltration tweeted, with hype, for Mina Majikina
[1:24:55] <WaterKirby1964> I definitely wanna try out Basara in the Future
[1:25:02] <cauldron00> omg thats dope
[1:25:15] <dasmesee> Who is hardest MU so far?
[1:25:17] <o_o_DeltaRed_o_o> Hey Sonic limsu9Smile sonics1Pogchamp sonics12EZ
[1:25:26] <DomBlazee> How punishable is it ?
[1:25:52] <WalkingDead5220> can u please tell me if Poison is a female
[1:25:55] <DomBlazee> Yeh
[1:25:56] <DomBlazee> Oh ok
[1:26:00] <Aeronage> The hardest matchup for poison is lucia obviously ssDudes
[1:26:24] <DomBlazee> Burned a meter at wasted a turn
[1:26:30] <DomBlazee> And
[1:26:31] <kweaxd> Poison looking kinda weak
[1:26:44] <dasmesee> They screwed her like Juri
[1:27:22] <Na__> They didn't screw her, now she has her own unique gameplay at least. She's not just a "shoto-like".
[1:27:38] <dasmesee> Xian thinks Poison is ass but I think too early to judge
[1:27:38] <WaterKirby1964> @walkingdead5220 Poison is a Female, but a Trans Woman
[1:27:50] <kweaxd> Her gameplay is much more interesting now, balance aside
[1:28:01] <WaterKirby1964> According to the development from Capcom
[1:28:21] <mobus99> LIES SwiftRage
[1:28:49] <dasmesee> Agree it should be plus
[1:28:50] <Na__> Because the plus on block move is the EX Whip I think
[1:28:57] <aleromero1> ex love me tender is still good against Sagat tho
[1:29:12] <aleromero1> if you have the read, it works against both fireballs
[1:29:20] <WaterKirby1964> @walkingdead5220 Hope this answer helps
[1:29:28] <Fullmetalross> wait did i just miss it, I thought EX LMT was zero?
[1:29:47] <Panic_at_the_Discord> if you have the read you shouldn't need to burn meter for it to be useful
[1:29:58] <dasmesee> If thats the case what is that move good for?
[1:30:06] <Panic_at_the_Discord> hell yeah
[1:30:11] <Aeronage> YUR
[1:30:36] <mobus99> If u have the read, then just jump in
[1:30:48] <sach1989> I was using poison yesterday and most fireball characters except ken and akuma destroys her.
[1:30:53] <Na__> I think this EXLoveMeTender is even faster than Juri(s one. And also -2
[1:30:55] <Fullmetalross> its only -2 on sagat/tall people
[1:31:02] <Fullmetalross> and if they block it crouchign it 0

[1:31:26] <WaterKirby1964> Big Bird was close to winning EVO, but congrats to Bonchan and Big Bird, for Top 2 at EVO
[1:31:35] <eviler86> if u miss time that sagat will dp the shit out of that
[1:32:04] <supers4iy4n_kid> So like any other character
[1:32:04] <mobus99> I would agree
[1:32:08] <Na__> The V-Skill is quite slow too, to deal with fireball I guess we also have to "read".
[1:32:37] <GasBurglar> She looks like her
[1:32:52] <Fullmetalross> lol
[1:32:52] <supers4iy4n_kid> LMAOOO

[1:35:11] <dasmesee> Lei? In what way?
[1:35:30] <Fullmetalross> which trade is more damage stance M or cr.hp?
[1:35:34] <kweaxd> we super turbo LUL
[1:35:34] <WaterKirby1964> @dasmesee Cop, the Running Pose from Renders
[1:35:42] <supers4iy4n_kid> Ryu finally got him a dominant mu LUL
[1:35:47] <dasmesee> Ahhh
[1:36:01] <mehding69008> Lei still in tekken? i loved him in tekken 2! big memory you bring back to me lol
[1:36:01] <sach1989> Vskill is hard to go through fb its just too slow and I was unable to do it on reaction
[1:36:39] <supers4iy4n_kid> So they should increase the speed of her whip?
[1:36:52] <madhatterbest> What changed your mind on the nostalgia costume?
[1:36:53] <dasmesee> Poor Poison aimzSad aimzSad aimzSad
[1:37:06] <mobus99> Cr HP any good in this situation?
[1:37:31] <WaterKirby1964> @mehding69008 Yes. Lei is back in Tekken 7, as Season 2 DLC, alongside Anna, Marduk, Armor King, Julia and Negan
[1:37:32] <madhatterbest> I thought you didn’t like it
[1:37:44] <dasmesee> Sucks she needs mter to be effective
[1:38:10] <mehding69008> @WaterKirby1964 ok i think fan gonna be happy

[1:38:53] <dasmesee> Well fuk
[1:38:58] <Fullmetalross> you can still get dp'd after theyget hit by it too right?
[1:39:02] <madhatterbest> No one talks about kage
[1:39:05] <Fullmetalross> or block*
[1:39:20] <frixky> I think her vskill is one of the worst in the game. free aa
[1:39:29] <WaterKirby1964> Forget G, Leroy Smith is the Real Deal
[1:40:02] <mehding69008> after spider man you can cross up if if crouch
[1:40:29] <Fullmetalross> interesting you can trap with it
[1:40:38] <howdoicomputer> seems difficult to manage risk with poison
[1:40:40] <Fullmetalross> yeah lol
[1:40:47] <dasmesee> So overall she struggles vs shotos and Sagat? What about Guile or Karin?
[1:41:00] <zerja89> zerja89 subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[1:41:02] <DEATHGOD15> that jLk is wack
[1:41:05] <Fullmetalross> Guile seems worse to me than sagat at least haven't played many shotos
[1:41:06] <WaterKirby1964> Anyway. Have a good day :)
[1:41:20] <Fullmetalross> Fullmetalross subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[1:41:30] <DEATHGOD15> hitbox is wack, misses a lot
[1:41:34] <Fullmetalross> I'll subscribe for being wrong lol : p
[1:41:41] <Aeronage> sonics12EZ
[1:42:11] <supers4iy4n_kid> can she combo off the cross up?
[1:42:13] <mehding69008> you have to do it at last moment
[1:42:16] <supers4iy4n_kid> oh nvm
[1:43:37] <mehding69008> yes with crouch lp

[1:44:23] <frixky> I agree

[1:44:33] <Chicken_Curry_Rice> was planning to use her vs shotos and guile
[1:44:33] <thefgtreehouse> ok thanks
[1:44:37] <mobus99> How tf does she re-wrap the whip every time DansGame
[1:45:19] <frixky> I feel like her only good matchups would be grapplers
[1:45:32] <mobus99> Or people with no fireballs?
[1:45:57] <dasmesee> How is she vs Birdie?
[1:45:58] <AngelicSilence> hiya
[1:46:07] <yunggrasshopper77> Well he is -3 on block with air fb
[1:46:19] <frixky> I think her biggest blow back is the push back on cr mp and her hitbox on hp
[1:46:32] <mobus99> If she ever does get used in tournament, shes def gonna be a secondary character
[1:46:48] <CHAMPION410> @sonic_sol let's see this poison in action
[1:46:48] <frixky> her cr.mp is amazing though

[1:57:48] <WalkingDead5220> samsho is still delay input netcode which means its still shit. SFV is still roll back which is better than any delay netcode
[1:57:50] <mobus99> It was a 5 bar. For maybe 3 seconds Kappa
[1:57:51] <leafSHADOW157> SFV in a nutshell.
[1:58:03] <psydaku> Blame leakers.
[1:58:07] <spacedetectivekh> We need that online tier list
[1:58:15] <mobus99> Delay netcode NotLikeThis
[1:58:24] <WalkingDead5220> guilty gear 2020 coming with GGPO netcode
[1:58:38] <mobus99> There would be no A or S tier netcode
[1:59:07] <ZippyPsycho> What about SoulCal?
[1:59:31] <psydaku> Probably Nightmares
[1:59:33] <WalkingDead5220> not confirmed but highly likely like 90% sure GG 2020 comes with GGPO cause ASW in 2018 said they are playing around with GGPO
[1:59:39] <spacedetectivekh> Isn’t SC close to tekken in terms of gameplay?
[1:59:41] <mobus99> Cuz it had no 50 Chun costumes Keepo

[2:05:37] <cauldron00> hey does anyone have a link to the poison discord
[2:06:10] <mobus99> Lmao nice
[2:06:17] <history1970s> unga bunga basically means button mashing
[2:06:23] <history1970s> without really putting too much strat into it
[2:06:27] <GasBurglar> Ah
[2:06:30] <GasBurglar> good to know
[2:06:35] <history1970s> i.e.... what i end up doing 90% of the time lmfao
[2:06:45] <ultimatum_nova> i thought unga was just rushdown
[2:06:54] <ultimatum_nova> or is it like shitty rushdown?
[2:07:05] <history1970s> ive mostly heard it used as going crazy without thinking abt ur next moves rly lol
[2:07:07] <mobus99> U N G A
[2:07:09] <history1970s> but i guess its subjective
[2:07:12] <hennesyhufflepuf> unga is instict
[2:07:14] <hennesyhufflepuf> Kappa
[2:07:17] <history1970s> lmfao

[2:09:53] <ultimatum_nova> ovreheat
[2:09:53] <hennesyhufflepuf> that lag
[2:10:02] <A4Roid> matrix fighter v
[2:10:03] <Crack______> The dojo name was a mixup
[2:10:08] <mobus99> This isnt your average everyday lag...
[2:10:11] <mobus99> This is...
[2:10:15] <mobus99> ADVANCED lag
[2:10:16] <riskbreakerz> i think ur stream lags
[2:10:44] <CountMeowingtonn> i finally found someone who is playing poison VoHiYo
[2:11:34] <ZeroCount> Finally a Poison! T.T
[2:11:39] <II3urNz> anyone else getting slow motion action sometimes online?
[2:11:46] <mobus99> If 120fps becomes standard next gen, are fighting games gonna move past 60fps?
[2:11:46] <tinyangrycrab> poison mains are toxic
[2:11:48] <archer3xd> One Poison in a tournament is all I wish for
[2:11:54] <archer3xd> Lucia is rampant fam
[2:12:11] <riskbreakerz> what are the chances infiltration will use poison?
[2:12:11] <tinyangrycrab> is poison weak?
[2:12:15] <tinyangrycrab> i thought she was surprisingly well rounded
[2:12:25] <mobus99> Shes good but has bad MUs so far
[2:12:26] <tinyangrycrab> bad vs rushdown?
[2:12:39] <tinyangrycrab> interesting
[2:12:48] <archer3xd> I feel she gets destroyed by Cammy tho
[2:12:52] <tinyangrycrab> i would have thought it was the lack of "get off me" that would cost her the most
[2:12:57] <archer3xd> Giver her one reversal and we good
[2:13:16] <ZeroCount> I miss not having a reversal. And fighting honda with her is frustrating
[2:13:48] <archer3xd> I guess she's a good character for me to learn not to rely on a dp
[2:14:06] <CarbonOtaku> fk that ex didnt kill
[2:14:20] <tinyangrycrab> the problem i have is that i'm addicted to random dps in sf games
[2:14:27] <tinyangrycrab> just randomly dping after strings
[2:14:33] <CarbonOtaku> lol
[2:14:35] <tinyangrycrab> so i can't play any character that won't let me throw my life away
[2:14:38] <mobus99> Audio is desynced a bit
[2:14:38] <archer3xd> I hate your kind lmao
[2:14:39] <sa1k0> ken main?
[2:14:40] <tinyangrycrab> with terrible dp decisions
[2:14:50] <ultimatum_nova> @mobus99 cos stream lagged befoe
[2:14:57] <tinyangrycrab> when they removed universal dp invulnerability in sf5 it was the beginning of the end for me misuFeels
[2:15:10] <sa1k0> no more yolo dps
[2:15:20] <KaZey77> KonCha
[2:15:20] <official_nakmatic> we got yolo throws now
[2:15:24] <tinyangrycrab> i didnt play ken but only because ipreferred ryus haircut
[2:15:33] <ultimatum_nova> there's the audio sync <3#
[2:15:48] <sa1k0> yolo ryu's dp?
[2:15:55] <tinyangrycrab> precisely
[2:16:19] <tinyangrycrab> i once beat somebody by dping on their wakeup and they sent me a really long xbox message that had a lot of swearing in it tinyanGERYTHONK
[2:16:31] <history1970s> it be like that
[2:16:36] <ultimatum_nova> their fault for waking up lol
[2:16:40] <tinyangrycrab> exactly
[2:16:53] <tinyangrycrab> if they didnt want to get dped they should have stayed lying down
[2:16:56] <archer3xd> If that HP had faster frames itd be heaven sent
[2:16:56] <GeoffTheHero> does poison have a dp
[2:16:58] <official_nakmatic> niggas got shit for delaying their wakeup LUL
[2:17:00] <tinyangrycrab> or used the forbidden technique... blocking....
[2:17:04] <mobus99> Geoff HeyGuys
[2:17:14] <sa1k0> I bleedPurple Poison's looks in this game, but Lucia seems more fun combo and gameplay wise >( :Z
[2:17:23] <Unsungmasterworks_> lol
[2:17:23] <history1970s> lucia is the devil confirmed
[2:17:24] <tinyangrycrab> lucia seems really cool
[2:17:26] <GeoffTheHero> i would have rage explosioned
[2:17:32] <GeoffTheHero> sup man
[2:17:33] <function_2> LUL
[2:17:34] <GeoffTheHero> you ready for sunday
[2:17:42] <sa1k0> so I'm undecided on which should I use my fm to buy yet
[2:17:46] <GeoffTheHero> ok cool i'm relying on you

[2:18:37] <tinyangrycrab> i feel like if she doesn't have the most disgusting ambiguous nonsense then it's not matching her theme
[2:18:57] <ultimatum_nova> no aa?
[2:18:59] <AustinApa> i hope you show me in private
[2:19:00] <mobus99> and lag
[2:19:09] <tinyangrycrab> tinyanGERY THE NEUTRAL tinyanGERY the most FRAUDULENT part of street fighter tinyanGERY BAN NEUTRAL tinyanGERY
[2:19:15] <history1970s> im sad that poison no longer has a move where she kicks the opponent in the crotch
[2:19:18] <history1970s> v in character imo
[2:19:18] <archer3xd> You think Lucia is overrated or is she rightfully hyped with her explosiveness?
[2:19:27] <Nightbot> If my stream randomly disconnects after a few hours of streaming i am not offline, I will come back online in roughly 1 minute. I don't mean to disconnect but I am experiencing packet loss issues.
[2:19:41] <tinyangrycrab> @history1970s have you seen honda super on abigail
[2:19:46] <frixky> has a godd aa normal
[2:19:53] <tinyangrycrab> he straight terminates that poor guys junk
[2:19:57] <archer3xd> oof
[2:20:00] <frixky> good vts
[2:20:11] <riskbreakerz> honda cpt ready?
[2:20:12] <spacedetectivekh> Lucia ready to go, just add water.
[2:20:17] <history1970s> omg... i have not. in all honesty, i am super noob baby irt sfv x) hence why im here. im trynna watch lotsa other players so i can have some idea of wtf im doing
[2:20:19] <CountMeowingtonn> but i wanna play poison VoHiYo
[2:20:19] <KingFossilFER> or kawfee
[2:20:36] <ClearlySuperman> !discord
[2:20:36] <Nightbot> https://discordapp.com/invite/cuPcGaA
[2:21:01] <history1970s> i panic so much lol
[2:21:10] <ZeroCount> @sonic_sol Know any tips against Honda as Poison?
[2:21:22] <archer3xd> I do enjoy playing Poison more than other characters, its an uphill battle but hey
[2:21:37] <ClearlySuperman> Honda is odee
[2:21:58] <ZeroCount> :<
[2:21:59] <itssa_gundam> Punk's playing Lucia
[2:22:01] <Timtation254> punk was playing lucia
[2:22:04] <riskbreakerz> punk plays lucia i think
[2:22:05] <scarletsilencer> Wish I had a better computer to play this game on : (
[2:22:05] <CarbonOtaku> punks not playing posion he plays lucia
[2:22:05] <CountMeowingtonn> he called her bad i think
[2:22:20] <Timtation254> but he thinks Honda is the best out of the 3
[2:22:25] <itssa_gundam> he called Lucia bad
[2:22:49] <scarletsilencer> What if Geki came back?
[2:22:59] <GeoffTheHero> im glad youre in a good mood
[2:23:03] <tinyangrycrab> i just wanna see some ryus in tournament
[2:23:06] <tinyangrycrab> i love my boi roo
[2:23:09] <riskbreakerz> give lucia a gun
[2:23:12] <Thick_Rmika> honda is scary
[2:23:16] <mobus99> We need a Geki costume for Vega
[2:23:51] <tinyangrycrab> give poison a vtrigger where she gets a second whip
[2:23:52] <tinyangrycrab> common sense
[2:24:12] <scarletsilencer> I swear, each iteration of Poison makes her head more porcupine-ish.
[2:24:13] <howdoicomputer> poison st hp should go as far as cr hp tbh
[2:24:38] <archer3xd> We still lowkey reppin Makoto sfv
[2:24:44] <mobus99> That would be OP, since she can cancel st hp
[2:24:52] <howdoicomputer> i know
[2:25:00] <tinyangrycrab> i think makoto in sf5 would look AMAZING
[2:25:11] <archer3xd> She would wreak havoc for real
[2:25:12] <mobus99> Makoto and/or Oro would make me satisfied
[2:25:16] <BigKahunaBanana> i was labbing @sonic_sol https://twitter.com/BigKahunaBanana/status/1159630508940124160
[2:25:18] <tinyangrycrab> with the kind of impact they put in a lot of the punches in sf5 animation and the chonky art style she would be so mean looking
[2:25:22] <tinyangrycrab> she would straight punch families
[2:25:22] <function_2> LUL
[2:25:34] <GeoffTheHero> poison said her bad days were behind her so she didn't need to continue fighting
[2:25:39] <tinyangrycrab> makoto would come to your house and punch your father
[2:25:42] <riskbreakerz> oro should be released by the end of the year
[2:26:17] <BigKahunaBanana> kk
[2:26:19] <BigKahunaBanana> one sec
[2:26:19] <scarletsilencer> @sonic_sol I know some people say that this game is horrible as it is, but I can never find a counter argument to that. Do you agree about people's thoughts on the game, or are people overreacting?
[2:26:41] <mobus99> People wouldnt still be playing if nobody liked it
[2:26:42] <A4Roid> isnt akumas 3f
[2:26:43] <tinyangrycrab> do people still think sf5 is like... super horrible? i thought they were mostly like "it's not too bad now, still a bit slow"
[2:26:43] <archer3xd> My favourite past time is realizing im not tominaga
[2:26:54] <VesperArcade> vesperShade
[2:27:00] <Dboi0422> @tinyangrycrab LUL
[2:27:10] <hennesyhufflepuf> could be worse
[2:27:14] <hennesyhufflepuf> could be MK11
[2:27:21] <tinyangrycrab> sf5 - "it's kinda ok" <--- put it on the box
[2:27:23] <GeoffTheHero> vesper the angel
[2:27:26] <mobus99> SF3 New Generation revival when? Kappa
[2:27:29] <QuotationMarX> Remove V trigger and most characters at the top wouldn't be there tbh
[2:27:48] <archer3xd> You guys think itd be SFVAE:___Edition or SF6?
[2:27:50] <DEATHGOD15> MonoPR, Fang player, posted some cool Poison vt1 setups
[2:28:03] <hennesyhufflepuf> unga
[2:28:12] <solarxlipse> Hahahaha I made a platinum Honda player rq hahahaha
[2:28:14] <scarletsilencer> I would play, but I don't have the funds for the console or PC
[2:28:18] <ZeroCount> God I love cr.mp. Even if its stubby
[2:28:37] <mobus99> Poisons buttons are great
[2:28:42] <solarxlipse> lol and it was a casual match too
[2:28:45] <Syirine> am I the only one seeing a completely black screen?
[2:28:51] <mobus99> Yes
[2:28:58] <hennesyhufflepuf> he was mashing
[2:29:01] <QuotationMarX> @scarletsilencer I personally wouldn't recommend playing on PC anyways
[2:29:02] <terrywolf1> The hardest of reads
[2:29:13] <scarletsilencer> @QuotationMarX any reason?
[2:29:16] <KingFossilFER> @Syirine try hovering the cursor over the screen
[2:29:35] <moddnz> QuotationMarX why? cohhHmm
[2:29:36] <blubald> kicked his router
[2:29:41] <QuotationMarX> @scarletsilencer PC version is extremely finnicky
[2:29:44] <archer3xd> lmao router tech
[2:29:46] <hennesyhufflepuf> YO
[2:29:52] <hennesyhufflepuf> these Alex buffs Kappa
[2:29:54] <scarletsilencer> @QuotationMarX How so?
[2:29:57] <KingFossilFER> alexnation
[2:30:02] <Syirine> this is twitch app but thanks for tryin to help
[2:30:03] <tinyangrycrab> like how can poison be bad when she has that forward throw with the slap
[2:30:06] <tinyangrycrab> like that throw is MONSTER
[2:30:16] <archer3xd> That throw is BM af
[2:30:17] <hennesyhufflepuf> i think he knows
[2:30:37] <CountMeowingtonn> i'm sorry my son, the netcode gods have abandoned you
[2:30:40] <VesperArcade> Looks fine to me vesperFroze
[2:30:45] <moddnz> He turned on his momVtrigger, pulling the cord cohhD
[2:30:48] <hennesyhufflepuf> eject
[2:30:52] <function_2> That speed
[2:30:55] <KingFossilFER> "daily"
[2:30:55] <ZeroCount> How can she be bad when she has her story costume.
[2:30:57] <tinyangrycrab> that guy using some advanced teleportation technology
[2:31:00] <hennesyhufflepuf> I CAN'T SEE I CAN'T FIGHT
[2:31:01] <GeoffTheHero> I remember when Vesper beat LTG and he said GGs and LTG got really mad
[2:31:02] <tinyangrycrab> must be from a more advanced civilisaiton
[2:31:07] <GeoffTheHero> I can't believe Vesper would BM LTG like that
[2:31:18] <ZeroCount> Or her battle costume for that matter
[2:31:29] <archer3xd> Rollbacks for days
[2:31:31] <scarletsilencer> I might try out Samurai Shodown when it comes to Switch.
[2:31:36] <blubald> just close your eyes and channel the degeneracy
[2:31:47] <archer3xd> Use your Peter tingle?
[2:31:48] <tinyangrycrab> ok heres what u gotta do, u cant see what hes doing so ur only option is to just go apeshit and never stop until either he or you is dead
[2:31:52] <riskbreakerz> this rollback is my daily experience playing sfv :D
[2:31:57] <tinyangrycrab> just run at him with hatred in ur heart
[2:31:59] <QuotationMarX> @scarletsilencer The list is long but to put it simple any update on PC causes the game to get stuttery even on good PC's it's soo bad they have guide on steam that has you jump through 40 hoops just to get it anywhere near stable
[2:32:08] <VVasto_Roseee> Yerr
[2:32:20] <mobus99> PC version runs perfectly fine for me
[2:32:29] <howdoicomputer> ALEX NAYSH
[2:32:30] <BigKahunaBanana> on akuma you l. jab instead of dash forward @sonic_sol warmicWin
[2:32:35] <function_2> @sonic_sol Did you forget to turn off turbo? CarlSmile
[2:32:36] <mobus99> But thats the nature of PC, inevitably some people will have issues
[2:32:37] <shredmaster96> yooo what up bro!!!!
[2:32:37] <scarletsilencer> @QuotationMarX Oh, I see. I think I could save up for a PS4.
[2:32:59] <archer3xd> I want my GG 2020 though, too bad i cant run it
[2:33:03] <blubald> your degeneracy isn't advanced enough for the online frontiers
[2:33:06] <blubald> have you tried ken
[2:33:09] <blubald> Kappa
[2:33:13] <CarbonOtaku> lool
[2:33:13] <tinyangrycrab> btw how come you use vt1 over vt2? vt2 seemed really cool but maybe im just dumb
[2:33:18] <VesperArcade> I still don't understand Poison at all
[2:33:25] <QuotationMarX> @mobus99 Yeah some people got lucky, I went 2 and 1/2 seasons without issues, but then season tanks on my pc
[2:33:25] <VesperArcade> sometimes after that up kick, she does V-Skill?
[2:33:30] <VesperArcade> like wtf is going on
[2:33:32] <QuotationMarX> *season 4
[2:33:41] <BlazerIke> 1 seems like the scarier choice
[2:33:50] <VesperArcade> When I learn poison I need to drag your ass into my stream
[2:34:07] <VesperArcade> waiting on my tasty food man, still going to be an hour lol
[2:34:18] <mobus99> I would play a set but it would likely be mad laggy
[2:34:20] <brotha_J91> ill fight you brotha
[2:34:20] <nivel96> what's the song pls?
[2:34:20] <Nationalgamingvanguard> I'll send you an invite
[2:34:21] <ultimatum_nova> i would but uk and shit internet
[2:34:21] <VesperArcade> I'll probly lag anyway lol
[2:34:22] <ClearlySuperman> Poison VT2 seems slept on already
[2:34:23] <bulldogmicrowave> im not human is that alright?
[2:34:25] <IGrimNinja> were you from?
[2:34:38] <scarletsilencer> @sonic_sol I hope I can be as good as you, so I too can clown on LTG LUL
[2:34:39] <VesperArcade> can you cancel the v-skill after that up kick?
[2:34:43] <history1970s> i like poison vt2!
[2:34:44] <solarxlipse> @sonic_sol I can if you don't mind the lag
[2:34:44] <VesperArcade> I'm so confused
[2:34:45] <QuotationMarX> He's an aigis
[2:34:48] <mobus99> When i play casual, every match is like a 2 bar, but against my friends its smooth
[2:34:56] <function_2> You forget to turn off turbo CarlSmile
[2:34:58] <QuotationMarX> Toaster is best girl
[2:35:14] <archer3xd> @VesperArcade you can cancel most moves into v skill
[2:35:42] <saiferoth> its just CFN
[2:35:52] <mobus99> Skullgirls Kreygasm
[2:35:55] <IGrimNinja> ill run a few
[2:36:01] <howdoicomputer> NRS games have ping at least
[2:36:14] <saiferoth> its so random too with the same person and same connection
[2:36:15] <archer3xd> NRS has good connection right?
[2:36:24] <Nationalgamingvanguard> that's me
[2:36:28] <saiferoth> yeah mk netcode is solid
[2:36:31] <bulldogmicrowave> You were rushing down in Samsho in GF with a life lead and somebody in chat said "why is sonic going in with a life lead" I told him "it's genjuro bro"
[2:36:33] <akaJoness> Yooo what are your thoughts on poison so far boss and who is your favourite character out of the new characters ??
[2:36:46] <mobus99> Jonesy HeyGuys
[2:36:51] <leafSHADOW157> AYYYEE @akaJoness !! jimHey jimHey OWL2019Tracer OWL2019Tracer
[2:37:01] <VesperArcade> uh oh
[2:37:22] <bulldogmicrowave> I think you're lagging or is that me???
[2:37:25] <mobus99> Ive barely seen any Honda
[2:37:28] <howdoicomputer> endbott bruh thats my poison color wtf
[2:38:14] <archer3xd> How do you actually anti-air with that, i just do c.mp
[2:38:47] <GoukiBryant> Let’s run a set tomorrow when I get Lucia sol
[2:39:01] <GoukiBryant> Probably tomorrow night
[2:39:07] <ClearlySuperman> DAT BAIT ❤️
[2:39:08] <akaJoness> Ahh I see ... I get the impression that poison is like menat where the match ups she wins are very good but the match ups she loses are terrible looooool
[2:39:21] <Voidemirl> can you explain v reversal plz? like what are the buttons?
[2:39:28] <mobus99> What does Menat lose?
[2:39:38] <riskbreakerz> triPout
[2:39:38] <ClearlySuperman> prolly Rashid
[2:39:51] <bulldogmicrowave> My phone is going nuts on thia stream.
[2:39:52] <ClearlySuperman> Akuma maybe
[2:39:56] <ultimatum_nova> @Voidemirl v-reversal in general or poison's?
[2:40:02] <GoukiBryant> Lucia/Rashid and Akuma @mobus99
[2:40:02] <akaJoness> Mika bison and rashid
[2:40:11] <KingFossilFER> ibuki?
[2:40:13] <blubald> can you costume code the hat off of poison?
[2:40:16] <GoukiBryant> And what jones said
[2:40:17] <Voidemirl> in general or m bison
[2:40:26] <ClearlySuperman> basically most aggro characters imo
[2:40:46] <ultimatum_nova> while blocking press forward+either all punches or all kicks, depending on character
[2:40:47] <history1970s> poison without her hat is like ibuki without her face mask
[2:41:01] <ultimatum_nova> some chars have escape vreversal some have strike
[2:41:09] <ultimatum_nova> costs 1 vguage bar
[2:41:24] <mobus99> It can be grabbed tho
[2:42:06] <Oortcloud9> Is LK your go-to after swing?
[2:42:24] <blubald> im sure it's been asked like a bajillion times but are you hyped for new GG
[2:42:37] <ClearlySuperman> ooohhh
[2:42:39] <ultimatum_nova> cr.MP has 5 active frames then?
[2:42:46] <mobus99> New GG, what?
[2:42:49] <mobus99> hol up
[2:43:06] <function_2> It's looks so good
[2:43:12] <ultimatum_nova> no it is 5 i looked
[2:43:14] <ultimatum_nova> that's nice
[2:43:16] <blubald> i hope it gets picked up like samsho has been picked up, looks gorgeous
[2:43:26] <bulldogmicrowave> Bro you gotta block!
[2:43:38] <Nationalgamingvanguard> I'm trying to!
[2:43:49] <ZeroCount> @sonic_sol you can get st.hp after a cr.mp the timing is just wierd.
[2:43:50] <bulldogmicrowave> You don't have to, but you'll do better.
[2:43:54] <KS_Tali> poisons so bad
[2:43:57] <dadboy1990> She does some nice dmg
[2:43:57] <ClearlySuperman> you need 5 active frames to cover both wake-ups?
[2:43:58] <Nationalgamingvanguard> ggs
[2:44:01] <blubald> this song is tight

[2:53:58] <Aef_kagemaru1987> in other words they want him to have over 80 which is nuts because he's a fun streamer
[2:54:38] <scarletsilencer> I wouldn't be too keen on that pertnership thing. But thats involving Drama, and You and I do not need taht
[2:54:40] <KS_Tali> her EX flip kick should be +2

[2:57:07] <KS_Tali> yo when you anti air with crouch MP, cancel it into web swing
[2:57:22] <KS_Tali> its a great cheese tactic online
[2:57:48] <Aef_kagemaru1987> I thing she more or less beats him in the range but I think she has a hard time against him everywhere else
[2:58:17] <Aef_kagemaru1987> gift who?
[2:58:22] <KS_Tali> heres a tip for the shoto match ups
[2:58:23] <ultimatum_nova> @KS_Tali
[2:58:26] <ultimatum_nova> this guy
[2:58:32] <ultimatum_nova> or girl iunno
[2:58:34] <Xenomy> @Xenomy is new here. Say hello! HeyGuys
[2:58:37] <Aef_kagemaru1987> Aef_kagemaru1987 gifted a Tier 1 sub to KS_Tali! They have given 47 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[2:58:38] <ClearlySuperman> wait, what happened? lol
[2:58:52] <KS_Tali> your medium QCB whip is supposed to be used to trade with them throwing fireballs
[2:58:52] <Nationalgamingvanguard> I feel like I have to play this game in intervals
[2:59:04] <Nationalgamingvanguard> I get too damn angry when playing Sfv
[2:59:15] <KS_Tali> because her whip does as much as 2 fireballs
[2:59:42] <KS_Tali> her ex flip kick is FREE as a reaction to all fireballs
[3:00:07] <function_2> that was sick
[3:00:14] <Aef_kagemaru1987> man playing out of his mind right now
[3:00:17] <KS_Tali> thanks kagemaru btw
[3:00:31] <Aef_kagemaru1987> @KS_Tali you earned it
[3:00:42] <ClearlySuperman> damn
[3:00:49] <leafSHADOW157> jimSip jimSip jimSip
[3:01:12] <scarletsilencer> GN Sol, gotta wake up for work.
[3:01:33] <bulldogmicrowave> @scarletsilencer this is a dream
[3:01:35] <KS_Tali> against characters without a DP after the upkick u can just hold upforward for a pseudo safe jump
[3:01:35] <scarletsilencer> GL on this evening's matches
[3:01:41] <oceanfromblue> uh i was just randomly gifted a sub and i wasnt even watching this stream lol, thanks
[3:01:43] <dexterwylde> What's this song?
[3:01:45] <Aef_kagemaru1987> I've seen players throw her legs out there like a dam dp
[3:01:58] <litecheese820> play list is Effin fire
[3:02:18] <hennesyhufflepuf> @sonic_sol just hold out till Astral Chain soundtrack drops
[3:02:22] <bulldogmicrowave> !song
[3:02:22] <Nationalgamingvanguard> Gn Sol. see you later, and thanks for the set!
[3:02:50] <dexterwylde> Pretty dope, curious what this song is
[3:03:01] <Aef_kagemaru1987> he was smart to crouch on her swing
[3:03:05] <oceanfromblue> sanford gave up on poison
[3:03:17] <KS_Tali> her stand Hk xx molitov also makes it upto +4 OB based on the distance that u land the HK from
[3:03:19] <bulldogmicrowave> damn shoto is a struggle huh
[3:03:22] <EssoUAE> Can you show us her crush counter combos please @sonic_sol
[3:03:36] <oceanfromblue> sanford said poison was too hard and wasnt playing the meta
[3:04:33] <Aef_kagemaru1987> @sonic_sol theory can poison get vt2 parried if she throws her whip out?
[3:04:45] <KS_Tali> hey Sol after your set if you go to training mode i can show you some goodies
[3:05:22] <KS_Tali> i find she does well against the shotos
[3:05:38] <KS_Tali> its just a god damn grind of your patience
[3:05:42] <Aef_kagemaru1987> lemme check for ya
[3:06:13] <KS_Tali> VT2 cant be parried
[3:06:50] <KS_Tali> u also dont do st.HP xx EX +2 whip enough
[3:06:58] <mehding69008> playing poison is just SO FUUUN GUYS im on it since day 1 guys!!
[3:07:02] <Aef_kagemaru1987> I meant to say if she throws out her normal with
[3:07:02] <ClearlySuperman> @ks_tali you think she fares well vs Sagat or Guile?
[3:07:10] <KS_Tali> yea
[3:07:18] <KS_Tali> but its a grind of your patience
[3:07:27] <hennesyhufflepuf> the title of this song pls
[3:07:39] <ClearlySuperman> I see. that makes sense
[3:07:52] <KS_Tali> well the only characters that i think she does well against is zangief lol
[3:08:22] <ClearlySuperman> just Gief? Abi too? or nah
[3:08:23] <Nightbot> Thanks for watching! If you wanna see continuing content; Youtube - https://www.youtube.com/c/SonicSol |Twitter - https://twitter.com/SonicMonarch | Discord - https://discordapp.com/invite/cuPcGaA
[3:08:48] <KS_Tali> never played her against abi
[3:08:49] <Jay4gamers1125> Jay4gamers1125 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Embrace Death!
[3:09:28] <ClearlySuperman> Abi might get in dat azz.. idk
[3:09:32] <mehding69008> lol im actually playing zan and a lot of zang with her and you right
[3:10:03] <Aef_kagemaru1987> her cr and st hp can be Vt2 punished by ryu
[3:10:26] <KS_Tali> thats the right way for that ex flipkick
[3:10:32] <KS_Tali> never pre emptive
[3:10:50] <KS_Tali> u could have grabbed that v reversal
[3:10:57] <ClearlySuperman> ex flipkick is safe?
[3:11:02] <Aef_kagemaru1987> It literally sucks her in to be hit at max range
[3:11:07] <KS_Tali> its -2
[3:11:46] <ClearlySuperman> @aef_kagemaru1987 like Dhalsim limbs
[3:12:20] <KS_Tali> btw her web swing can have its momentum altered if your holding forward or back
[3:12:25] <manjesticdong> lol
[3:12:25] <KS_Tali> during the swing
[3:12:33] <Aef_kagemaru1987> @ClearlySuperman pretty much I even noticed that it's all her whips minus command throw
[3:12:48] <ClearlySuperman> WUT @ks_tali
[3:13:01] <KS_Tali> its very subtle
[3:13:03] <manjesticdong> can you whip the fireball?
[3:13:11] <ClearlySuperman> does that affect mixups?
[3:13:40] <KS_Tali> yes because you can cross up or stay in front
[3:13:41] <ClearlySuperman> kinda like Laura command dash
[3:13:47] <ClearlySuperman> yeah
[3:14:00] <Timtation254> @sonic_sol your poison looking a lot better. getting that polish going
[3:14:31] <KS_Tali> she has an unmoving shimmy in a very specific scenario
[3:14:50] <ClearlySuperman> I really like meaty-ing with jab for that extra frame trap
[3:15:28] <Aef_kagemaru1987> meanwhile menat is unharmed when she uses her orb normals but I guess it's treated like a projectile
[3:15:29] <KS_Tali> forward throw > meaty st.hp xx EX whip > crouch jab > wait for throw whiff
[3:15:36] <manjesticdong> i thought his name was testicless
[3:15:56] <ClearlySuperman> it's not? lol
[3:16:33] <Aef_kagemaru1987> nicely done
[3:16:33] <ClearlySuperman> can you meaty after ex flipkick hits?
[3:16:39] <KS_Tali> yes
[3:16:58] <ClearlySuperman> I tried, but I couldn't figure out what to press
[3:17:02] <KS_Tali> the +2 whip
[3:17:40] <solarxlipse> @sonic_sol and chat alright everyone I gotta call it a night
[3:17:50] <ClearlySuperman> b+hk was a good answer
[3:18:10] <ClearlySuperman> night man
[3:18:19] <solarxlipse> @clearlysuperman night
[3:18:35] <Nightbot> Thanks for watching! If you wanna see continuing content; Youtube - https://www.youtube.com/c/SonicSol |Twitter - https://twitter.com/SonicMonarch | Discord - https://discordapp.com/invite/cuPcGaA
[3:18:40] <KS_Tali> you also never use CR.HP
[3:18:52] <KS_Tali> its a very good low that goes under fireballs
[3:19:13] <Aeronage> well its mad negative but if they dont punish it why stop using it
[3:19:15] <Karate_moses> mad negative but nice range
[3:19:16] <KS_Tali> its a slightly safer version of the L qcb whip
[3:19:26] <Nightbot> If my stream randomly disconnects after a few hours of streaming i am not offline, I will come back online in roughly 1 minute. I don't mean to disconnect but I am experiencing packet loss issues.
[3:19:42] <Aef_kagemaru1987> he wanted to trade with your whip
[3:19:44] <KS_Tali> safer in the sense of total frame count
[3:20:16] <ClearlySuperman> most characters can't punish the cr. hp, right? unless point blank
[3:20:23] <KS_Tali> yo when you do the ex leg rise into web swing combo
[3:20:31] <Aef_kagemaru1987> whiff punish
[3:20:37] <KS_Tali> end in J.MK
[3:20:58] <ClearlySuperman> yeah, it's too far to sweep
[3:21:16] <KS_Tali> and then do an immediate jump forward MK for frame kill
[3:21:25] <KS_Tali> and meaty with Cr.MP on landing
[3:21:31] <KS_Tali> covers both too
[3:21:38] <KS_Tali> and looks cooler
[3:21:43] <KS_Tali> and does more dmg
[3:22:58] <KS_Tali> yes, and in the corner u always stay infront but it looks like u will side switch
[3:23:04] <KS_Tali> quite ambiguous
[3:23:27] <manjesticdong> i just realized hp links to cr mp
[3:24:03] <KS_Tali> u almost did it
[3:24:15] <KS_Tali> i think ur like +3/+8
[3:25:19] <leafSHADOW157> H A D O K E N
[3:25:24] <leafSHADOW157> LUL
[3:25:34] <KS_Tali> when ur full screen cheesing
[3:25:43] <KS_Tali> whiff a special for meter Kappa
[3:26:01] <manjesticdong> oh wait it has to be counter to link :(
[3:26:06] <leafSHADOW157> The teleports are real in this game. Like very very REAL.
[3:26:11] <bulldogmicrowave> Same
[3:26:30] <KS_Tali> bro
[3:26:34] <KS_Tali> good shit
[3:26:37] <hickzx> @sonic_sol lul great stuff
[3:26:40] <KS_Tali> see how ambiguous that was
[3:26:43] <ClearlySuperman> WOOOOOOOO
[3:26:57] <leafSHADOW157> This music is sooo GUD... :3
[3:27:07] <leafSHADOW157> But that was good stuff indeed.
[3:27:18] <TheBonelessChild> What was that song?
[3:27:36] <hickzx> but this guy is so lag,
[3:27:43] <KS_Tali> yea that was weird the first time cuz u went into the corner
[3:27:51] <CountMeowingtonn> down in rookie rank is where all the good connections are Kappa
[3:27:52] <KS_Tali> but it should always stay in front
[3:28:30] <KS_Tali> oh yea for meterless web swing combos, stand hp combos clean into web swing
[3:29:04] <omnikainv> Yo what's up thought I'd pop in for a bit
[3:29:17] <KS_Tali> also the block string of, cr.mp > stand MP > stand hp xx web swing is pretty cheesy for people who hadnt seen it
[3:31:18] <omnikainv> damn that sucks
[3:32:26] <crazyspanks> Yo shout out to Aef_kagemaru1987 for the gifted sub
[3:32:55] <KS_Tali> in the corner when ur trigger is active and you go for the ex leg rise into web swing ending in J.MK, instead of doing the jump forward MK frame kill
[3:33:06] <KS_Tali> throw a high molatov and do cr.MP
[3:33:21] <KS_Tali> cover all beat 3F meaty AND molotov support
[3:33:35] <omnikainv> I read your twitter post about poison, does she get outzoned?
[3:33:40] <omnikainv> By shotos
[3:34:17] <crazyspanks> sonics1Law
[3:34:39] <KS_Tali> pls use some CR.HP in neutral
[3:34:55] <KS_Tali> this ryu is too comfortable walking and dashing in neutral
[3:35:18] <KS_Tali> cr.hp makes em want to jump or sit still after a couple whips to the toes
[3:36:45] <KS_Tali> dont ever use it after throw break tho
[3:37:33] <omnikainv> insert castlevania whip smack
[3:37:35] <KS_Tali> you want to use it around round start distance
[3:38:16] <KS_Tali> and u want to use it to challenge then throwing fireballs
[3:38:26] <KS_Tali> since it goes under and trades
[3:38:27] <II3urNz> poisons a trap
[3:38:38] <omnikainv> still mighty fine though!
[3:39:19] <omnikainv> she just comes with a "bonus"
[3:39:22] <II3urNz> until she slaps you with her weiner
[3:39:27] <Yomi_Sama> lol
[3:39:47] <zeoniccrab> people still believe she a trap in 2019 LUL
[3:39:48] <omnikainv> Let her
[3:40:09] <evilpunisherll> I'll do poison no matter what
[3:40:12] <KS_Tali> she was a real female in SF3, final fight, and USF4
[3:40:22] <KS_Tali> shes a trap in SFV tho
[3:40:26] <KS_Tali> u see that face
[3:40:54] <KS_Tali> u also rarely use stand HK
[3:40:58] <ClearlySuperman> stand block the tatsu
[3:40:59] <KS_Tali> thats like her best button
[3:41:09] <II3urNz> use standing cock block
[3:41:59] <KS_Tali> stand HK (tip) xx molotov is +4 OB and sets u up for another st.HK or a stand hp
[3:42:31] <KS_Tali> AA leg rise lets u get 2 dashes
[3:42:45] <II3urNz> nice
[3:42:46] <function_2> PogChamp
[3:42:51] <function_2> sonics1Pogchamp
[3:42:54] <nevernude_> cant you CC sweep vt hit molotov for a 50/50
[3:43:17] <nevernude_> maybe use qcb mk to land in front and qcb hk the cross up
[3:43:44] <KS_Tali> i wish molotov on a grounded opponent kept them grounded
[3:44:29] <KS_Tali> always use the J.LK after the AA cr.mp xx web swing
[3:45:10] <mehding69008> youwin!!!!
[3:45:11] <KS_Tali> the J.Lk is the only air button that can hit both sides
[3:45:21] <Aeronage> ssDudes
[3:45:23] <KS_Tali> the H
[3:45:23] <ClearlySuperman> ahhh
[3:45:30] <KS_Tali> the HK might whiff
[3:47:00] <Mau_Cat> why vtrigger 1? is the best for this matchup?
[3:47:27] <KS_Tali> VT1 has a lot of utility
[3:48:05] <KS_Tali> VT2 would have been good if you could do the command grab on reaction to v reversal
[3:48:19] <meg0o> sonicsol is cute!!
[3:48:42] <KS_Tali> but the only way to use the command grab to beat v reversal is by pre emptively doing it with a read
[3:49:08] <biscuitxl> which upkick version are you using for aa, or does it vary depending on spacing?
[3:49:18] <KS_Tali> use LK
[3:50:23] <KS_Tali> oh yea sol, another good way to use her is by looking for them to jump, and then when they do, pop VT1, AA with LK upkick xx bomb > AA HP whip
[3:50:57] <Mau_Cat> the qcf + K doens't have any upper body invulnerability right?
[3:51:09] <KS_Tali> it does but not frame 1
[3:51:23] <KS_Tali> so you have to be ready to AA with it
[3:51:34] <KS_Tali> and cant use it against deep jumps
[3:51:47] <Mau_Cat> all 3 or only ex?
[3:51:50] <KS_Tali> cr.mp better for the deeper jumps
[3:51:53] <vforcharlie> i like to poke with qcf + lp
[3:51:55] <NeverKnowsBest00> the dark unga
[3:51:59] <NeverKnowsBest00> the DARK UNGA
[3:52:13] <KS_Tali> all of them mau
