[0:32:41] <strawhatrein> I like Poison with her long, hedgehog hair
[0:32:42] <ellisdraps> Waddup Big G! @sonic_sol capcomG
[0:32:45] <spacedetectivekh> Capcom know what they doing
[0:33:56] <Iodized_Salt> Oh hol up? You can use nostalgia costume with stock costume with a costume code?
[0:34:49] <Eagleseye360> When she does the over head kick she says ‚Äúkick some ass‚Äù love hearing that
[0:35:13] <Iodized_Salt> Ah. Gotcha SeemsGood
[0:35:16] <Na__> I wish we could use the long hair with the default costume too.
[0:35:30] <xxVnastyxx> c.mk is +4 without ch? Then we can combo people trying to walk back after a light?
[0:35:41] <Iyokuu> Lucia is a bully in this game. As a fellow Poison player, it's annoying.
[0:37:09] <anonymousjosh10> Kind of off topic but which samsho dlc character you looking forward to the most?
[0:37:12] <Supreamy_> IDK WHAT ELSE TO DO BibleThump
[0:37:18] <Supreamy_> lol
[0:37:31] <Kimimaro2111> is poison your main now?
[0:38:22] <Iyokuu> Poison might bring me back to the game to be honest. I've been saying this since they announced her and after actually playing her, I like her a lot.
[0:39:18] <Na__> Do you have any feelings about what V-Trigger to pick against what type of opponent yet ?
[0:39:37] <YaBoyPz> is there a gab in between st.hp and qcb.hk?
[0:39:38] <EXunspect> @sonic_sol poisons her hp is soooo good man omg
[0:39:43] <Supreamy_> this is aids lol
[0:40:12] <ayeneotokyo> song?

[0:42:23] <cuckingbythebook> @sonic_sol you think its gonna become commonplace to throw the molotov just after the stun when they're getting up for the extra damage, seems like a good optimization
[0:43:39] <ellisdraps> Yo in every samsho stream i've been saying they should add another character this season... KK was listening :)
[0:43:39] <Jelestine> Yo Sol, what's happening? Did you see my girl Mina is coming back?
[0:43:46] <Na__> I'm still wondering if it's a good choice to use both cocktails in one combo, like after Heavy Heel, or if it's better to save the second one
[0:43:53] <AfroRickey> Hey are you timing the cr.Mp after the wipe swing setup or are you just immediately pressing cr.Mp
[0:44:02] <Jelestine> LMAO
[0:44:04] <omnikainv> Yo what's up
[0:45:42] <SashaOnStage> Can you show crushcounter combo please when you can?
[0:46:05] <omnikainv> That was dirty!
[0:46:24] <YaBoyPz> my man's got them juicy frame kills. that was tight!
[0:46:27] <Supreamy_> nerf poisen Kappa
[0:46:46] <thiAgo3666> poison is a good traveco
[0:46:47] <shorky> nerf honda KAPPA
[0:46:57] <SashaOnStage> Lucia DansGame
[0:47:08] <shorky> ME
[0:47:11] <RevrJr> mad Lucia hype atm but Honda is the busted one tbh
[0:47:27] <thiAgo3666> one question poison is top tier??
[0:47:29] <shorky> i'm looking honda but he suck
[0:47:30] <SashaOnStage> i stream poison in russia but im bad)
[0:47:33] <Iyokuu> I haven't seen anything abotu Honda at all besides my friend.
[0:47:36] <WoLFpwr> gllty plays Poison too
[0:47:44] <Na__> Honda is definitly really strong too
[0:47:52] <Kimimaro2111> do you see poison a popular pick in future tournaments?
[0:47:59] <slippo> yo sol
[0:48:01] <Iyokuu> @thiAgo3666 That's such a horrible question to ask on a character that was just released. lol She's strong as fuck, but she literally just came out.
[0:48:08] <cuckingbythebook> I think people will start messing around with poison when they lucia hype dies down
[0:48:13] <mau5trapv> how come you dont use crhp to poke?
[0:48:34] <Iyokuu> @cuckingbythebook They'll mess around with Poison AFTER they start seeing us Poison players doing busted/cold shit with her. It always works that way.
[0:48:42] <Esper_Charm> any tips on executing her stance cancel to increase combo potential or is it just practice makes perfect?
[0:48:46] <RevrJr> @mau5trapv I think because it's like - 11?
[0:49:06] <thiAgo3666> @Iyokuu valeu irm√£o
[0:50:18] <mau5trapv> whats the main use of crmk? is it like uriens
[0:50:27] <Iyokuu> @mau5trapv It's like Ibuki's.
[0:50:29] <thiAgo3666> poison is a fuking travec√£o
[0:50:41] <Xeijines> jimmyPerfect
[0:50:43] <SugarJLeonard> that was mad good
[0:50:46] <RevrJr> um....
[0:50:47] <AfroRickey> Ok I figured cause I did your set up after I seen you do it last night but I would have to time it when it came to back roll but I‚Äôve improved it so you can immediately do cr.Mp for both getups, would you like to know?
[0:50:48] <Iyokuu> Good poke. Can combo into lp>heel kick
[0:50:57] <ayeneotokyo> she is so good yo
[0:51:25] <Na__> Poison has two diferent jump HP, I didn't know. but I think by holding forward HP the normal looks diferent in the air.
[0:51:39] <xxmallcop2xx> You make Poison look sick
[0:52:02] <Eagleseye360> You should play in ranked

[0:52:30] <ayeneotokyo> her throw game is od set up s are od good buttons she kind like get it
[0:52:31] <Incendio_M> I like how they gave Poison a new win pose because Kolin stole hers.
[0:52:47] <RevrJr> yooo my man got setups
[0:53:14] <omnikainv> smooth
[0:53:24] <YaBoyPz> you can switch sides there PogChamp
[0:53:29] <Nightbot> If my stream randomly disconnects after a few hours of streaming i am not offline, I will come back online in roughly 1 minute. I don't mean to disconnect but I am experiencing packet loss issues.
[0:53:31] <YaBoyPz> does it depend on their rise?
[0:53:49] <sodush> I like to hitconfirm stHP into qcbMP and stance cancel if it's blocked. But dunno how unsafe it is on block.
[0:54:02] <SugarJLeonard> finally get more time with this character tonight Kreygasm
[0:54:06] <YaBoyPz> i see. yeh yeh.kends do similar tings
[0:54:15] <YaBoyPz> kens l

[0:55:09] <omnikainv> who?
[0:55:22] <SashaOnStage> you can punish lucia's fireballs attempts with crHP
[0:55:29] <toadkillerdog7> I've been playing a lot of Poison and seen plenty of Lucia. But does anyone have a grasp on how Honda is now?
[0:55:50] <spacedetectivekh> I‚Äôve only seen twitter clips of Honda
[0:56:10] <spacedetectivekh> But I hear Honda is sick
[0:56:23] <toadkillerdog7> Honda was my original SFIV main. Been a long time.
[0:57:07] <YaBoyPz> I've already stole like 3 set ups labbing rn LMAO
[0:57:16] <YaBoyPz> that vskill one is dirty!
[0:57:26] <Iyokuu> You didn't go to EVO?
[0:57:37] <omnikainv> Yo we gonna see Sonic's glory in clearer image!?
[0:57:48] <SashaOnStage> you always resetting hp on block?
[0:58:04] <toadkillerdog7> You got something on here to tell me what the jams you're listening to are?
[0:58:09] <spacedetectivekh> Sonic coming in HD to a twitch stream near you
[0:58:11] <toadkillerdog7> I'm digging this tune.
[0:59:17] <function_2> @sonic_sol Are you going to compete in SFV again along side with Samsho?
[0:59:22] <Xeijines> jimmyPerfect
[0:59:42] <function_2> Got you
[1:00:40] <omnikainv> Get slapped son
[1:00:44] <RevrJr> frame data is a social construct pokiHmm
[1:00:55] <WhiteHound_BR> Nice music! o/
[1:01:16] <toadkillerdog7> @sonic_sol How do you feel Poison is in this compared to SFIV? Do you feel she has potential in the pro scene?
[1:01:18] <silencio7> LUL
[1:01:49] <Supreamy_> fuck lucia LUL
[1:01:51] <thenovikov> hey, you can double dash after light heel?
[1:02:03] <toadkillerdog7> @sonic_sol Also, what is this song?
[1:02:07] <thenovikov> oh, thx
[1:02:10] <silencio7> you can if they backroll
[1:02:12] <RevrJr> we just don't know yet
[1:02:23] <silencio7> true true
[1:02:33] <fuzzyrpg> no kidding. every 5 mins some asking how good these characters are. chill out
[1:02:34] <YaBoyPz> is it actually possible to hit St.hp into qcb.mp. stance cancel on block. I don't think I'm doing it fast enough. I wanna be able to react to the hit from St. hp
[1:02:35] <RevrJr> she is super fun tho at least for me
[1:03:49] <shorky> fuck honda
[1:03:54] <baroldo123> What are these fusion sounding tunes?
[1:04:12] <toadkillerdog7> For real, I wanna know what we're listening to here. I'm digging it and want to listen to more.
[1:04:31] <omnikainv> I think we need a castlevaina skin
[1:04:36] <sodush> @YaBoyPz There should be enough time to react if you hit with stHP into stance and release MP version of it or stance cancel for block.
[1:05:11] <YaBoyPz> I thought so. I'm just bad at doing the stance cancel quickly
[1:05:54] <fuzzyrpg> if ur really close with the crush counter. u can micro walk into another HK LK launcher kick thing
[1:06:10] <toadkillerdog7> I can't seem to do jack shit with V trigger 2.
[1:06:15] <Supreamy_> STOP REACTING LUL
[1:06:17] <function_2> He never learns NotLikeThis
[1:06:18] <anonymousjosh10> Is poison kind of like an anti-zoner?
[1:06:20] <YaBoyPz> that's so good
[1:06:37] <sodush> Poison is Johnny function from GG Kappa
[1:06:48] <sodush> Mist Finer and all
[1:06:54] <toadkillerdog7> Cool, thanks man. I appreciate the advice.
[1:07:18] <toadkillerdog7> @anonymousjosh10 I dunno really, but she has pretty good tools to anit-zone.
[1:07:20] <YaBoyPz> I like that it's qcb input aswell and she dosent have a dp PogChamp
[1:07:45] <YaBoyPz> makes it easy to land whilst moving
[1:08:06] <anonymousjosh10> @toadkillerdog7 yea it seems like it
[1:08:28] <spacedetectivekh> I know that whip hurt like a mf
[1:08:47] <RIB0SOMA> so how's she? good tier or low tier?
[1:09:00] <Mysterious_J> Lmao
[1:09:00] <tatomagix> The idk tier
[1:09:01] <omnikainv> Belmont this shit!
[1:09:18] <Mysterious_J> I was like where is he going with this combo LUL
[1:09:23] <sodush> Poison for character loyalism on my part. Lucia looks boring design wise
[1:09:28] <toadkillerdog7> They change her so much from SFIV, but I personally think this iteration is more fun and less fireball spam bullshit.
[1:09:35] <A4Chills> There are good characters and great players.
[1:09:42] <A4Chills> Be a great player.
[1:09:50] <tatomagix> Fuck Female Ken
[1:10:02] <omnikainv> If only he was in vega's halloween skin
[1:10:08] <Mysterious_J> Honda is lit
[1:10:13] <sodush> Ken and K' fused and genderswapped = Lucia
[1:10:20] <spacedetectivekh> Ken getting replaced
[1:10:28] <toadkillerdog7> I wanna get Honda when I get paid. Only had enough for Poison for now.
[1:10:35] <function_2> LUL
[1:10:37] <silencio7> LUL

[1:24:21] <supers4iy4n_kid> EVO*
[1:24:25] <RevrJr> yeah the music is a lil loud tbh

[1:37:51] <anonymousjosh10> I can see her doing well against guile and sagat
[1:38:04] <lazarusnecrosis> He says the Light whiffs on her when it shouldn't. I think his inputs are just late.
[1:38:24] <ConvoBreaker> Oh dude if it's the light he's just late I'm pretty sure
[1:38:59] <lazarusnecrosis> He's doing it on a crouching training bot.

[2:24:24] <mobus99> Those crossups are brutal
[2:25:04] <xSouIx> BRO you just said have more confidence in yourself, maybe its just the matchup
[2:25:06] <hotdog_exe> low forward is a way of life @Supreamy_
[2:25:10] <PoklaSo> why would he think losing with a new character makes him suck?
[2:25:25] <salindy13> ^
[2:25:32] <Thick_Rmika> its still day 1 Poison give it time
[2:25:35] <SashaOnStage> @xSouIx its not a matchup ryu weaker than poison
[2:25:45] <mehding69008> day 2
[2:25:47] <xSouIx> ,
[2:25:50] <Supreamy_> your poison is godlike day 1, just give it some time
[2:26:01] <Thick_Rmika> sorry day 2 LUL
[2:26:09] <mobus99> This is a day 2 char vs Ryu, a char people been labbing since 1991
[2:26:10] <elliotterodriguez> KappaRoss
[2:26:21] <Supreamy_> wait this update came out yesterday?
[2:26:24] <Supreamy_> damn im late
[2:26:26] <PoklaSo> and this ryu is rather random it seems
[2:26:30] <d3vil_triggered> @mobus99 exactly
[2:26:46] <supers4iy4n_kid> SFV Ryu is the only different Ryu LUL
[2:26:46] <njoye> !discord
[2:26:46] <Nightbot> https://discordapp.com/invite/cuPcGaA
[2:26:52] <mehding69008> he s pretty Fucking good DAMM
[2:27:05] <elliotterodriguez> @mehding69008 not really
[2:27:33] <mehding69008> HES man sonic poison is monster man
[2:27:51] <solidlane> That corner v-skill mixup works like 50% of the time for me
[2:27:53] <Fullmetalross> if you hit the medium normal to early or late you can lose or gain 1f of advantage in my testing
[2:28:02] <King_Gold_> Raw v skill does sail over most straight projectiles
[2:28:03] <elliotterodriguez> @mehding69008 I thought you were talking about the Ryu LUL
[2:28:04] <mobus99> Ryu VT1 just needs a total overhaul, give him his 3S Denjin unblockable, make it a 3 bar, 2 uses
[2:28:12] <Fullmetalross> so perfect meaty might have had too much advantage
[2:29:00] <mehding69008> @elliotterodriguez im he resist to sonic so hes good
[2:29:20] <elliotterodriguez> @mehding69008 ig
[2:29:57] <RevrJr> yo this ryu is godlike
[2:30:23] <mehding69008> yes im wit you revr
[2:31:16] <alaskanpipeline0> hey ggs man i have to go
[2:31:19] <mehding69008> maybe vskill
[2:31:28] <alaskanpipeline0> thanks for the matches
[2:31:51] <PoklaSo> does poison's vskill jump through fireballs?
[2:32:03] <Fullmetalross> no it can clear them sometimes
[2:32:06] <supers4iy4n_kid> Sonic what was your first fighting game?
[2:32:08] <mehding69008> glad you have to go! lollll
[2:32:17] <King_Gold_> It jumps over most regular FBs, it's not invincible though.
[2:32:18] <Syirine> umm
[2:32:24] <PoklaSo> indeed, so there's no need to beat yourself up
[2:32:34] <Bat_Dork> !discord

[2:32:54] <mehding69008> absolutly!!
[2:33:06] <xSouIx> he had to go down forward his job
[2:33:10] <PoklaSo> it's a 2 day character really. can't expect to be perfect
[2:33:13] <elliotterodriguez> @sonic_sol No Sol you just can't play SF5
[2:33:16] <elliotterodriguez> LUL
[2:33:24] <wooca301> are you playing on pc?
[2:33:33] <mobus99> ps4
[2:33:46] <mehding69008> low foward??
[2:33:50] <supers4iy4n_kid> Oh shid Mikeand1kie??
[2:33:58] <alaskanpipeline0> if you'd rather me lose i can do that too
[2:34:19] <PoklaSo> I guess he's just frsutrated losing to your kind of style?
[2:34:49] <mehding69008> GG ALAaska its Nothing wrong with you lol, he upset on himself i think
[2:35:08] <alaskanpipeline0> i just dont like him getting upset everytime we play
[2:35:15] <alaskanpipeline0> i enjoy playing with him
[2:35:43] <mehding69008> so continu and dont give importance to his humor
[2:35:48] <Thick_Rmika> i think Poison VT2 is better in the long run
[2:36:29] <sodush> long range cmd grab is pretty reactable though but having that close range one is somewhat nice
[2:37:38] <solarxlipse> @sonic_sol and chat wats up solboys
[2:37:47] <wooca301> namec
[2:37:59] <FLCLGamer> Ahh, her close range command grab is fun and comboable.
[2:38:00] <wooca301> name of song anyone know
[2:38:10] <PoklaSo> @alaskanpipeline0 I'm a gold too. and when falke first came out I used it to beat a UGM falke. He got really upset cos my shit random style actually beat him, tiwice
[2:38:24] <PoklaSo> I guess sol is suffering from the same frustration?
[2:39:00] <alaskanpipeline0> i can understand it. when i lose to some bulshit in smash it can get frustrating
[2:39:14] <Broomega00> How is everyone doing ;D
[2:39:54] <PoklaSo> Using any other character he would have killed me with using a little finger
[2:39:57] <FLCLGamer> I'm doing fierce and fabulous Broomega.
[2:40:04] <wooca301> @broomega00 im doing fine thx for asking
[2:40:37] <Broomega00> Glad to hear it guys :)
[2:40:48] <ThodaPopHS> @ThodaPopHS is new here. Say hello! HeyGuys

[2:42:28] <supers4iy4n_kid> Really thought we was getting a Marvel 4 announcement at EVO
[2:42:32] <supers4iy4n_kid> FeelsBadMan
[2:42:53] <mobus99> Marvel Super Heroes getting an Arcade 1-Up cab is a good sign, at least
[2:42:58] <tralalad1ngdong> sometimes, it's fine to let out your frustations. you'll feel afterwards better than if you just keep it bottled inside yoursel
[2:43:07] <wooca301> i thoght marvel 4 was gonna get announce to
[2:43:22] <wooca301> "thought"
[2:43:24] <mobus99> We already got Marvel 4, its called MVCI Kappa
[2:43:31] <wooca301> lmao
[2:43:42] <supers4iy4n_kid> @mobus99 Yeah and Sonic 06 is Sonic Adventure 3
[2:43:58] <mobus99> Hereos is SA3 and u cant convince me otherwise SwiftRage

[2:45:08] <supers4iy4n_kid> been about like 10 years
[2:45:22] <mobus99> A fucking decade of no MAHVEL BabyRage
[2:45:27] <LightSpdAeon> @mobus99 I'm playing it on my ps3 right now LUL

[2:46:08] <LightSpdAeon> Nega Scott is so good
[2:46:20] <xSouIx> true is difficult but what r u doing right now when your talking to us, your already further then you think
[2:46:45] <mobus99> Unless ur Menat
[2:47:00] <RTY_KC> you're right man lol
[2:47:01] <PoklaSo> who is Sol's main?
[2:47:04] <LightSpdAeon> I remember when MvC2 was taken off shelves and it cost $100+. Then they brought it back on PS3
[2:47:10] <RTY_KC> i like poison but i won't main her for that reason
[2:47:25] <mobus99> I still have a ps2 copy luckily, but no proper case
[2:47:28] <hotdog_exe> from what ive expierenced poison has crumble under pressure
[2:47:45] <howdoicomputer> give poison a 3f invul dp
[2:47:55] <LightSpdAeon> Did they take away her DP?

[2:48:18] <bulldogmicrowave> Gen is minus LOL
[2:49:13] <mobus99> SFV Gen is -1 life Kappa
[2:49:30] <wustachema> all those are safe
[2:49:38] <Slaynman> regular butt slam is -2 on front hit
[2:49:39] <Fullmetalross> you can't punish the butt once you block it
[2:49:44] <argief> @argief is new here. Say hello! HeyGuys
[2:50:07] <supers4iy4n_kid> S H I M M Y
[2:50:08] <tigerarar> HI MAN
[2:50:14] <Slaynman> you down to play sonic or nah
[2:50:14] <tralalad1ngdong> who is the strongest ouf the 3 new characters?
[2:50:18] <bulldogmicrowave> Just mocking the fact that Genjuro is busted
[2:50:20] <Tuxadracles> PERFECT CUT LUL
[2:50:26] <mobus99> I feel like alot of moves are only safe cuz they were safe in SF2, but if these chars were made now theyd be unsafe af
[2:50:29] <DomPressesButtons> that song timing'
[2:50:33] <Tuxadracles> She said take a hike and that comes on
[2:50:34] <tigerarar> yea
[2:50:43] <Slaynman> damn thats the one im playing
[2:50:43] <wustachema> Honda has really far grab range
[2:50:56] <supers4iy4n_kid> SourPls
[2:50:57] <wustachema> Farther than you think
[2:51:12] <hotdog_exe> -4
[2:51:13] <tralalad1ngdong> @mobus99 cody says hi
[2:51:17] <NosferatuLIVE> -4 light headbutt
[2:51:19] <Checktrap> -4
[2:51:24] <tigerarar> YES
[2:51:53] <Slaynman> if he does light headbutt from farther away they only thing punishing it is gief crouch lp
[2:52:16] <nevernude_> how plus is hp whip cancel?
[2:52:25] <bulldogmicrowave> that Vreversal damage wow
[2:52:26] <Nightbot> Thanks for watching! If you wanna see continuing content; Youtube - https://www.youtube.com/c/SonicSol |Twitter - https://twitter.com/SonicMonarch | Discord - https://discordapp.com/invite/cuPcGaA
[2:52:38] <mehding69008> Honda hard to punish
[2:52:43] <zombieslayer115> @sonic_sol I have a question for you on versus ukyo and what up
[2:52:50] <hotdog_exe> honda is aids
[2:53:03] <tralalad1ngdong> as he should be :)
[2:53:19] <Nightbot> If my stream randomly disconnects after a few hours of streaming i am not offline, I will come back online in roughly 1 minute. I don't mean to disconnect but I am experiencing packet loss issues.
[2:53:22] <mobus99> He seems like a faster Gief with worse defense
[2:53:22] <Fullmetalross> you probably can't consistently punish light headbutt. st.lk will be your best bet
[2:53:53] <Slaynman> ex headbutt is a measly -26
[2:53:56] <hotdog_exe> hands are all safe
[2:54:05] <Fullmetalross> heavy is -2, light is +2
[2:54:08] <Fullmetalross> ex is -2
[2:54:13] <Fullmetalross> for hands*
[2:54:20] <zombieslayer115> @sonic_sol when I rolled forward try to get off the floor thr ukyo did the tsubame when I try block it can I block it or not
[2:54:23] <Checktrap> with armor !
[2:54:29] <Fullmetalross> he only moves on heavy and ex
[2:54:41] <Fullmetalross> you won't take a mixup afer light tho, the pushback is way too far
[2:54:45] <Checktrap> they dont last the same amount of time
[2:54:47] <NosferatuLIVE> from the sound he makes or number of hits you block
[2:55:10] <NexusWuolf4> What are these characters? when they get released?
[2:55:16] <mobus99> 2 days ago
[2:55:19] <ayeneotokyo> do mk later
[2:55:27] <Broomega00> Yo that was SICK
[2:55:39] <tigerarar> @zombieslayer115 im think you can block it
[2:55:50] <bulldogmicrowave> mk as in mortal kombat LOL
[2:56:00] <Bat_Dork> @sonic_sol maybe jp. mk a bit later
[2:56:02] <zombieslayer115> @tigerarar I try blocking it
[2:56:06] <Slaynman> mp headbutt -7, hp headbutt -12
[2:56:17] <Menat> which character
[2:56:18] <ayeneotokyo> no the air mk for the set up if your to high the crouch mp will wiff
[2:56:19] <hotdog_exe> are you gonna try rim in samsho?
[2:56:29] <Fullmetalross> -2 is for hundred hands lol
[2:56:36] <Slaynman> and as I said before, ex headbutt is only -26
[2:56:38] <tigerarar> bug lady isb ass me no buy mk11
[2:56:43] <tigerarar> is
[2:56:44] <bulldogmicrowave> On god thought that was hilarious you thought mk was medium kick
[2:56:53] <omnikainv> What I miss?
[2:57:07] <sodush> I think even medium headbutt is safe against poison
[2:57:11] <zombieslayer115> its Teiga:O
[2:57:14] <Hundred_Hand_Slap> did somebody say my name?
[2:57:24] <mobus99> Honda hella broken, he gets hundred hands, we all got like only 2 man wtf

[3:08:28] <Hundred_Hand_Slap> I remember fucking a hot asian chick in 2000 with these tunes playing in the background from my Dreamcast version.
[3:08:28] <mobus99> Marvel Super Heroes, XMen v SF, MVC1, MVC2, maybe throw in CotA, online mode, all in one package, charge whatever the fuck u want just gimme Kreygasm

[3:09:48] <xxOne51xx> what y
[3:09:57] <Nationalgamingvanguard> bruh the MU of Poison vs Akuma is so bad
[3:10:00] <bulldogmicrowave> @sonic_sol How viable you think poison will be in competetive?
[3:10:17] <xxOne51xx> anyone u invite to play mvc2 and says no, is not a fighter
[3:10:18] <Nationalgamingvanguard> he basically just says "Fuck your anti airs"
[3:10:38] <Hundred_Hand_Slap> @mobus99 it was more organic than that. I was playing A LOT of MvC2 back then. The music was mostly always playing in those days idle on the menu screen. Whenever I hear the music it always reminds me of those days. Lol
[3:10:41] <Tuxadracles> I wish V reversal could knock out

[3:41:41] <Shoryudojo> too much to type in chat lolBut to stop his jump ins you need to ex upper whip .....
[3:41:45] <blackshieldg> @mobus99 True but can‚Äôt he jump over that too?
[3:41:48] <silencio7> the vt1 oki is mad good

[3:42:40] <Shoryudojo> doesn't she have a UP lose command grab?
[3:43:56] <sodush> juggling with qcfPP and bottle in a combo might do a lot of damage with burning effect.
[3:44:19] <omnikainv> Why does Akuma need half of what he has?
[3:44:36] <Nationalgamingvanguard> because capcom says fuck you
[3:45:02] <JordantheKitty> vt2 works off of more stuff though
[3:45:32] <JordantheKitty> holy shit that hang on music
[3:45:34] <Shoryudojo> I played a poison in sets earlier and the threat of command grab made a difference in my opinion. just my opinion
[3:45:35] <sodush> there's no oki after qcfPP?
[3:45:36] <CardsMageAnime> @sonic_sol hello sir
[3:45:50] <JordantheKitty> vt2 works easier off of aa heel for instance
[3:45:59] <JordantheKitty> or regular light heel without an ex combo
[3:46:03] <silencio7> you can react to the fullscreen cmd grab
[3:46:22] <LES_89> @sonic_sol It's only 180 damage?
[3:46:36] <Shoryudojo> but you've been tossing out these molotov's and haven't been getting anything ? see my point

[3:48:30] <matt_master1988> Take care
[3:48:33] <Shoryudojo> whip attacks is her game though? no ?
[3:48:57] <tigerarar> can she have ex leg
[3:48:58] <bulldogmicrowave> Poison is a zoner?
[3:49:08] <mobus99> EX Leg isnt invincible
[3:49:22] <mobus99> She does have a 3f tho
[3:49:28] <tigerarar> can she have ex leg with i frames
[3:50:08] <mobus99> Dat fire damage tho

[3:52:12] <mobus99> What are u using to AA
[3:52:15] <JordantheKitty> use l heel as an aa for most jump ins, it's really good

[3:52:49] <sodush> There's no oki after qcfHP and ex version? Or is there other reason you're not using the move?
[3:52:54] <mobus99> She has heel, cr mp, and heavy whip
[3:53:18] <Nationalgamingvanguard> I use it for jump ins yet these mother fuckers already hit me before Heel comes out

[3:54:15] <Nationalgamingvanguard> welp I got banned
[3:54:22] <spacedetectivekh> who's harder to AA yoshi or akuma??
[3:54:29] <Nationalgamingvanguard> fuck it I'm playing soul calibur
[3:55:11] <Listonnyc> does she have a 3 framer?
[3:55:50] <JordantheKitty> holy shit
[3:55:52] <Xolawa> yes
[3:55:53] <JordantheKitty> the comebacks
[3:55:55] <WocHie> nice recovery
[3:56:27] <Listonnyc> the she can press the 3 framer after the second down strong
[3:56:41] <Listonnyc> because standing strong is 7 frames
[3:56:44] <Elvipesal> doesn't the swing avoid the air fireball?
[3:56:57] <WildAccusations> @sonic_sol Cammy cant have two jabs strings w/o push block but Akuma gets 3 M.p >_>
[3:57:07] <Elvipesal> ? NotLikeThis
[3:57:33] <leeroy2019> she is almost too thicc in this game
[3:58:25] <spacedetectivekh> akuma is a tank
[3:58:31] <Listonnyc> does she have a Dp?
[3:58:49] <tigerarar> no
[3:58:56] <Listonnyc> unfortunate
[3:59:06] <JordantheKitty> her sf4 dp sucked balls anyway
[3:59:18] <WocHie> RIP
[3:59:35] <Listonnyc> It's better to have a bad dp than no Dp. just saying
[3:59:40] <Shoryudojo> 8 frames
[3:59:40] <Listonnyc> It's 8
[4:00:25] <QuotationMarX> I hate fighting Akuma with a passion
[4:01:04] <itssa_gundam> @leeroy2019 that's literally impossible
[4:02:05] <leeroy2019> @itssa_gundam lol
[4:03:02] <spacedetectivekh> mhmm that was tricky
[4:03:25] <leeroy2019> i like her most of the 3 so far
[4:04:00] <itssa_gundam> same; I mean it's impossible not to when you look at her Kappa
[4:04:14] <KingFossilFER> bad akuma
[4:04:17] <MaiWaifuGaming> Do you think Poison was better when she had a fireball like in SF4 or do you think her having long range whip attacks is better?
[4:04:21] <QuotationMarX> No jumping
[4:04:30] <KingFossilFER> lol
[4:04:37] <AntiSky101> @sonic_sol @Teiga great set guys :)
[4:05:20] <Savage_Impulse> ‚ÄúYour name is GOUKI boy! No air fireballs‚Äù
[4:05:25] <Listonnyc> Probably better with the Fireball because she had set play and zoning
[4:05:39] <Savage_Impulse> AKUMA KINTE
[4:05:42] <Listonnyc> and a dp
[4:06:07] <JordantheKitty> i think strike zoning is better in this game
[4:06:08] <JordantheKitty> look at menat
[4:06:15] <blackshieldg> @listonnyc She still sorta has zoning with the whip and cocktails.
[4:06:36] <Listonnyc> Yeah but her offense was safe
[4:06:42] <Savage_Impulse> The whip sound is hilarious
[4:06:59] <Listonnyc> could steal turns back with Ex fireballs
[4:07:38] <blackshieldg> @listonnyc true. However I think she seems more complete like this. It didn‚Äôt make since that she had a fire ball to me
[4:07:47] <Listonnyc> But she's like a completely different character though
[4:08:07] <detroitdeion> did they just put poison in this game?
[4:08:18] <Listonnyc> I do think her design is pretty cool
[4:08:48] <blackshieldg> @listonnyc Agreed.
[4:09:01] <King_Gold_> SF4 Poison had strong FB setups and good safejumps. We'll see what SF5 Poison has.
[4:09:14] <King_Gold_> meant FBs
[4:09:21] <King_Gold_> meaty!
[4:09:26] <JordantheKitty> the audio get mad desynced for anyone else?
[4:09:28] <blackshieldg> Hey who do you think is gonna do the best in tournaments out of all the new character?
[4:09:56] <Listonnyc> I play Sagat and obviously playing a character that wins because of neutral is hard in sfv
[4:10:18] <psydaku> what i miss b
[4:10:19] <Pondersleuth> People are saying Lucia is the strongest of the 3.
[4:10:19] <omnikainv> It's a bit de-synced
[4:10:30] <King_Gold_> Probably Lucia, but I'm hoping some insane player like Xian starts labbing Poison and takes her to tourneys
[4:10:44] <Listonnyc> I think Lucia is the strongest out of the 3 as well
[4:10:52] <omnikainv> Audio
[4:10:53] <luckydouble> the stream audio
[4:10:55] <AntiSky101> game audio, just happened
[4:11:18] <Listonnyc> she has the same forward walk speed as Cammy
[4:11:28] <omnikainv> Sweet
[4:11:28] <AntiSky101> fixed SeemsGood
[4:11:29] <mobus99> There we go
[4:11:35] <Listonnyc> has a 3 framer
[4:11:40] <Listonnyc> an ex dp
[4:11:41] <blackshieldg> Yeah I agree but just wait until the Honda players come in and start killing people
[4:11:46] <Listonnyc> Anti dps
[4:11:49] <psydaku> i find it funny that Akuma calls Poison a brat.
[4:12:04] <mobus99> I want a new character whos V trigger makes the other player move at 30fps Kappa
[4:12:15] <Listonnyc> He offense is strong
[4:12:25] <blackshieldg> Same with poison. Lucia just seems like a starter character to me with not much potential
[4:12:46] <Listonnyc> and she has slight zoning ability
[4:12:51] <blackshieldg> I mean that fire ball is actually pretty freaking good but still
[4:13:04] <Listonnyc> even if she just uses it to get in

[4:15:56] <King_Gold_> Do you know yet if M heart raid is a true blockstring with CA?
[4:16:02] <Listonnyc> @blackshieldg not much potential?
[4:16:27] <Listonnyc> she might be a top 10 character lol
[4:17:11] <ShaydoGaming> Man I played nash and switched to poison? Im enjoying giving up throw invuln reversal for better walkspeed lmao
[4:18:20] <ShaydoGaming> I actually only looked at 1 bar and no bar combos with her lmao
[4:19:37] <King_Gold_> You feeling this MU more or is he just getting sloppy?
[4:19:55] <Listonnyc> He thought you'd respect the demon
[4:21:54] <Listonnyc> +8
[4:22:46] <cellovidaloka> @cellovidaloka is new here. Say hello! SeemsGood
[4:23:18] <RevrJr> is the vskill safe ? LUL
[4:24:02] <Listonnyc> well purple is +1
[4:24:37] <Listonnyc> you can't mash Jab on it
[4:25:07] <Teiga> last one
[4:25:19] <Listonnyc> no he has a 3 frame jab
[4:25:28] <Listonnyc> He always wins
[4:25:39] <Listonnyc> That's why you're losing there
[4:25:56] <Listonnyc> Oh yeah I if he uses Mk there's a gap
[4:26:03] <Listonnyc> it sucks
[4:26:23] <JordantheKitty> i can't wait for the patch notes in november
[4:26:27] <JordantheKitty> when they'll totally nerf akuma this time
[4:26:30] <Listonnyc> I used to use Akuma so his stuff works on me more
[4:26:46] <Listonnyc> because I know how bad it is to challenge
[4:27:05] <omnikainv> Dude it's been two seasons of nerfs and he's still too good
[4:27:15] <JordantheKitty> they "nerfed" him
[4:27:24] <JordantheKitty> they made one random ex move nobody ever really used much anyway -2
[4:27:31] <Listonnyc> they nerfed his V-trigger1
[4:27:33] <JordantheKitty> and made his vt1 slightly less but still broken
[4:27:45] <Listonnyc> But they buffed regular Akuma
[4:27:57] <ilikecandy13> my bald friend @buklaoz is really good with poison and uses her amazon swing very well
[4:28:07] <Listonnyc> He's actually overall stronger than he was
[4:28:36] <Teiga> people complaining about akuma. . . but im rarely using the broken shit about akuma lmfao
[4:28:48] <Listonnyc> Lol
[4:29:03] <Listonnyc> Do more standing mk red Fireball

[4:33:13] <Listonnyc> to be honest holding the Fireball isn't cheap. it's just regular chip damage. no + frames

[4:36:53] <whmatt> What nice lil doosey of a combo that was
[4:37:06] <Listonnyc> neutral jump
[4:37:13] <Wideawakeanimal> she can't do anything about fireball without meter?
[4:37:20] <mehding69008> i bet we gonna see Poison at CPT
[4:37:29] <tralalad1ngdong> i hope we do
[4:37:36] <Hmanylilly> down hp
[4:38:02] <mehding69008> mee too
[4:38:03] <Listonnyc> use that long low
[4:38:06] <Teiga> this matchup seems bad lol
[4:38:12] <King_Gold_> I hope she wins and some degenerate player gonna get to design a nsfw outfit for her.
[4:38:17] <Listonnyc> you'll win in damage
[4:38:24] <JustFrameAndre> this doesnt look fun lol
[4:38:35] <tralalad1ngdong> @King_Gold_ a man of culture 4Head
[4:38:54] <Wideawakeanimal> Fuudo would make a godlike poison costume I bet LUL
[4:39:18] <tralalad1ngdong> @Teiga bad for who? akuma or poisoin?
[4:39:20] <Listonnyc> if he spaces it better you can empty jump to advance
[4:39:20] <mehding69008> lol
[4:39:38] <King_Gold_> His FBs too fast to get a heart raid trade?
[4:39:49] <Wideawakeanimal> hold on, that dynamite is a 2 bar v trigger? That's OD!
[4:39:59] <Teiga> @tralalad1ngdong poison
[4:40:03] <Hmanylilly> good job
[4:40:09] <Hmanylilly> kill that top tier
[4:40:10] <ShadesBajeena> is vskill no bueno for fireballs?
[4:40:49] <omnikainv> Alrighty night guys
[4:41:02] <Wideawakeanimal> does she have a 3 frame button?
[4:41:30] <JordantheKitty> yep
[4:41:32] <JordantheKitty> s.lp
[4:41:34] <King_Gold_> st:lp
[4:41:50] <Wideawakeanimal> god shiet. I've been all in on honda. Need to check poison out
[4:41:59] <JordantheKitty> poison is super fun
[4:41:59] <Wideawakeanimal> good*

[4:43:41] <JordantheKitty> i was waiting for that ex flip
[4:43:41] <Teiga> lol son
[4:43:55] <Teiga> the way this matchup looks
[4:43:57] <ikkyusan> gj BloodTrail
[4:44:02] <Teiga> its not good
[4:44:02] <Wideawakeanimal> idk bruhk, look like she fighting akuma well lol
[4:44:11] <JordantheKitty> she does not fight akuma well
[4:44:16] <JordantheKitty> we don't have an answer for air fireball or any of his presure
[4:44:17] <Listonnyc> Lol
[4:44:39] <whmatt> Liston, our hero solo0rPog
[4:44:39] <ShadesBajeena> she really gotta take it
[4:44:40] <Listonnyc> It's definitely 6-4
[4:44:51] <Listonnyc> Lmfao
[4:45:15] <ShadesBajeena> da prince Kreygasm
[4:45:24] <Wideawakeanimal> @JordantheKitty well that's dayum near every character lmao
[4:45:35] <JordantheKitty> i mean yeah
[4:45:36] <JordantheKitty> it is akuma
[4:46:03] <Wideawakeanimal> let me rephrase it then, looks like she can hold her own
[4:46:21] <JordantheKitty> inb4 random-ass demon
[4:46:32] <Blaq_AciD> :(
[4:46:33] <Teiga> i think it might be a lil worse
[4:46:38] <Teiga> you shouldve stunned
[4:46:55] <Listonnyc> Lol I was giving her the benefit of the doubt
[4:47:04] <Listonnyc> I think is worse
[4:47:19] <TopTierHarley> this looks rough
[4:47:49] <TopTierHarley> I'm enjoying learning with you learning though
[4:47:52] <Listonnyc> He's also not doing everything he can though
[4:48:18] <Listonnyc> I'll reserve my match up judgment for a couple of weeks
[4:49:09] <Teiga> @Listonnyc im playing pretty reserved
[4:49:18] <Teiga> cause i wanna see what her answers
[4:49:18] <Listonnyc> Yeah I can tell
[4:49:21] <Teiga> are lol
[4:49:29] <Listonnyc> Lol I could tell
[4:49:57] <Listonnyc> no point in mauling completely. You wouldn't learn anything on both sides
[4:50:27] <whmatt> Teiga is unshimmiable
[4:50:36] <MagnificentBlack> @teiga But you play Akuma, so no props LUL
[4:50:36] <Listonnyc> I'll play you with Akuma, Sagat and Lucia tomorrow
[4:51:49] <Listonnyc> I only tried her
[4:51:55] <Teiga> ggs
[4:52:00] <Teiga> this matchup seems grim
[4:52:05] <Listonnyc> Cuz she's never been in the game
[4:52:11] <Teiga> cause it doesnt seem like she doesnt have a consistent answer to anything
[4:52:16] <Teiga> at any range
[4:52:22] <Nightbot> Thanks for watching! If you wanna see continuing content; Youtube - https://www.youtube.com/c/SonicSol |Twitter - https://twitter.com/SonicMonarch | Discord - https://discordapp.com/invite/cuPcGaA
[4:53:17] <Listonnyc> I feel like she's have problems against Sagat
[4:53:18] <Nightbot> If my stream randomly disconnects after a few hours of streaming i am not offline, I will come back online in roughly 1 minute. I don't mean to disconnect but I am experiencing packet loss issues.
[4:54:08] <Listonnyc> honestly I think if a character has problems vs Sagat they're probably mid
[4:54:16] <Mrbritt2you> Mrbritt is in the hizouse
[4:55:06] <Listonnyc> you get 3?
[4:55:43] <Listonnyc> Sagat beat her in Usf4 too
[4:55:45] <JordantheKitty> not on sagat high fireball at least
[4:55:53] <JordantheKitty> it probably works on other characters
[4:56:01] <AzureRift> how about her heel kick?
[4:56:18] <Blaq_AciD> ive been trying to crHP high tiger shots
[4:56:29] <AzureRift> fuck i was thinking of playing this character but ur swaying me not to LOL
[4:56:39] <JordantheKitty> nah poison is good and cool
[4:56:59] <Listonnyc> How negative is down hp
[4:57:10] <Blaq_AciD> punishing high shot isnt so bad
[4:57:12] <Blaq_AciD> its -11
[4:57:20] <AzureRift> she looks really set up reliant
[4:57:20] <Listonnyc> ok
[4:57:33] <spacedetectivekh> damn poison not tournament material, rip
[4:57:38] <FlashKix> you know you picking Honda and Akuma in tournament Kappa
[4:58:16] <AzureRift> okay but overall what tier do u see this character being
[4:58:45] <Listonnyc> Is there a hurt box on the whip normals
[4:58:50] <Mrbritt2you> üòÇ
[4:58:56] <Blaq_AciD> very much so @Listonnyc
[4:59:04] <Mrbritt2you> Is being ugly
[4:59:07] <Listonnyc> lol
[4:59:44] <Listonnyc> I think Lucia is better than Sakura though
[4:59:53] <AzureRift> Oh yeah way better
[5:00:03] <Listonnyc> easily top 10 to 15
[5:00:19] <jamesgent> i wanna see someone godlike pick up poison and rly make her work
[5:00:21] <AzureRift> I can see this character easily being in the top 8
[5:00:24] <alaskanpipeline0> #lowforward
[5:00:47] <Listonnyc> she has stuff
[5:00:59] <Listonnyc> It's her + frames
[5:01:16] <Listonnyc> she can do reverse block strings
[5:01:25] <AzureRift> But yeah same with you. I played so much poison in ultra that i have to make her work in this
[5:01:26] <whmatt> Costume code?
[5:01:42] <Listonnyc> down strong standing strong is also good
[5:02:06] <jamesgent> both mps are start up 5
[5:02:12] <Listonnyc> standing Mp is 5 frames
[5:02:24] <tigerarar> and if chk hit you v skill and loop it
[5:02:54] <Listonnyc> you can combo into Ex Tackle after mp
[5:03:15] <jamesgent> playing lucia vs playing poison it feels like u can do whatever tf u want lol
[5:03:18] <Giggadelic> CrMp CrMk Combo on counter hit
[5:03:48] <Listonnyc> if you hit them on the 2nd Mp
[5:03:59] <JordantheKitty> did you see that you can mess with her close fireball with her kick special thing
[5:04:05] <Listonnyc> It's good to be able to cancel the mp
[5:04:16] <Listonnyc> you can Sweep too
[5:04:36] <Listonnyc> She's + after Sweep
[5:04:41] <Listonnyc> Dash up
[5:04:58] <Listonnyc> and walk
[5:05:32] <Listonnyc> Same walk speed as Cammy
[5:05:41] <Listonnyc> But has Karin buttons
[5:06:07] <Listonnyc> U can kick it with 214 k
[5:06:13] <Listonnyc> Lol yeah
[5:06:26] <Listonnyc> I like options
[5:06:37] <Listonnyc> I'm already playing Sagat
[5:06:57] <Listonnyc> I need a character that demolishes Dhalsim
[5:07:49] <Listonnyc> that will be hard because it's so far into the cpt
[5:08:15] <ShoryuQuinn> Akuma is good, not many good Akuma players
[5:08:20] <Listonnyc> I think Lucia is Cpt ready
[5:08:41] <spacedetectivekh> lol CPT ready
[5:08:51] <spacedetectivekh> thats the perfect term
[5:09:06] <Listonnyc> Cpt Approved
[5:09:07] <spacedetectivekh> the new question is, is the character CPT ready lol
[5:09:18] <Listonnyc> lol
[5:09:34] <JordantheKitty> they're all playing lucia lmao
[5:09:48] <Listonnyc> Honda is probably strong
[5:09:56] <tigerarar> honda gona smash every one
[5:10:02] <Listonnyc> because he usually beats offense
[5:10:13] <JordantheKitty> honda is busted man he has so much good shit
[5:10:14] <Listonnyc> the game is only offense
[5:10:22] <Lulu19> honda has no reversal, he's free to pressure
[5:10:23] <JordantheKitty> he has amazing aas too
[5:10:33] <spacedetectivekh> samsho was blessing lol
[5:10:40] <spacedetectivekh> *a
[5:11:03] <tigerarar> we all playing these 900 hp bicthes honda gona show us the way
[5:11:17] <dweebenheimer20> Is Nash good now?
[5:11:27] <Listonnyc> does she have 900
[5:11:29] <spacedetectivekh> nash still has no legs
[5:11:30] <Listonnyc> Lmao
[5:11:39] <dweebenheimer20> @spacedetectivekh what about arms?
[5:11:39] <JordantheKitty> poison is 950
[5:11:48] <Listonnyc> Lucia?
[5:11:50] <spacedetectivekh> @dweebenheimer20 only one
[5:12:00] <Listonnyc> wow
[5:12:02] <dweebenheimer20> @spacedetectivekh alkFax
[5:12:11] <Listonnyc> they gave her 950
[5:12:20] <Listonnyc> they fucked up
[5:12:22] <Menat> do you like poison more than nash now?
[5:12:35] <ThanosThaTITAN> LOL
[5:12:38] <Menat> Kreygasm yes
[5:12:45] <dweebenheimer20> two huge reasons to play her
[5:12:51] <itssa_gundam> and she also got a thicc booty Kreygasm
[5:12:54] <Listonnyc> and Lucia is blonde
[5:13:10] <Listonnyc> lol
[5:13:11] <gunjudo> She's not as dumb as akuma, he needs 900
[5:13:49] <Listonnyc> she has a slide
[5:13:54] <Grimlockfly> SeemsGood100 SeemsGood100 good info
[5:13:59] <Listonnyc> you can't zone her
[5:14:11] <Menat> Lucia op
[5:14:16] <gunjudo> Her shit can anti air behind her, that's insane
[5:14:35] <spacedetectivekh> Lucia out here makin noise
[5:14:41] <Listonnyc> She's blatantly Cpt ready
[5:14:45] <Slaynman> you down to play sonic or nah
